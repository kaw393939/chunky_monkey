In the year 1852, the French writer and translator Théophile Gautier made a journey to the city then known as Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Thanks to the new technology of the steamship that now criss-crossed the Mediterranean, he made the journey from Paris in just under 11 days. Gautier stayed in the city for nearly three months and during that time he wrote a book full of his observations. As a young man, Gautier had dreamed of becoming a painter and he'd spent much of his life as an art critic, and so his descriptions of the city of Istanbul during this time are always infused with the language of art, as though the city were a painting he was appraising. The harbour crowded with ships of all nations and rippled by caiques gliding about in every direction, and above all, the wonderful panorama of Constantinople itself displayed upon the opposite shore. This view is so strangely beautiful that it is hard to credit its reality or to believe that it is anything but one of those theatrical scenes prepared to illustrate some eastern fairy tale, and bathed by the fancy of the painter and the brilliancy of the gas lights in a radiance purely celestial. Gautier walked the streets of Istanbul for weeks, visiting its markets and cemeteries, wandering down the narrow alleys and crumbling cobbled boulevards, and all the time writing about what he saw. Everywhere he went, he became increasingly aware of the vanished history of this ancient city. While the Ottoman Turks who lived there increasingly referred to their city by the name Istanbul, Gautier, along with much of the rest of Europe, knew it by a different, much older name. That name was Constantinople, and it was a city that had been at the heart of another very different empire, one that had been the foremost power in Europe for centuries. This was a power known as the Byzantine Empire, or more simply, as Byzantium. Byzantium had its beginning as the eastern half of the Roman Empire. While the west of that empire fell, the east remained. It lasted for another thousand years after what people commonly think of as the fall of Rome. It stood and endured, and in its great libraries, it preserved and protected the knowledge of the ancients. But the ruins of that great city now littered the streets of Istanbul. Of all the ruins that Gautier visited, none affected him so deeply as the site of the Great Walls of Constantinople, which had once been legendary around the world. We would have gone along the whole outer extent of these ancient walls of Byzantium had we not been too much fatigued. I do not suppose that there is in the world a ride more austerely melancholy than upon this road, which extends for nearly a league between a cemetery and a mass of ruins. The ramparts, composed of two lines of wall flanked with square towers, have at their base a large moat, at present cultivated throughout, which is again surrounded by a stone parapet forming, in fact, three lines of fortification. These are the walls of Constantine, such as have been left of them after time, sieges and earthquakes have done their worst upon them. Gautier writes movingly about the masses of overgrown vegetation now growing on the ancient walls, fig trees sprouting from their towers, and vines and grasses bursting from the cracks in the masonry. Here and there, a gigantic crevice severed a tower from top to bottom. Farther on, a massive wall had fallen into the moat, but where the masonry was wanting, the elements had supplied earth and seed. A shrub had supplied the place of a missing battlement, and grown into a tree, the thousand tendrils of parasitical plants had sustained the stone which upheld it.
otherwise would have fallen. The roots of line of walls raised to the sky, its battered profile draped with ivy and gilded by time. The whole haunting scene seemed like something out of a dream or a magical tale, as the weight of the city's history seemed to weigh down on him. It was difficult to believe that a living city lay behind the defunct ramparts which hid Constantinople from our view. It had been easier to believe oneself near some of those cities of the Arabian legends, all the inhabitants of which had been, by some magical process, turned into stone. As he walked the length of those walls under the soft Istanbul sun, Gautier must have asked himself, how could the mighty walls of such a fortress city ever have fallen? How could a city that had once been at the center of the world now be home to such a scattering of rubble and ruin? What in all the world had happened to the great legacy of Byzantium? My name's Paul Cooper and you're listening to the Fall of Civilizations podcast. Each episode, I look at a civilization of the past that rose to glory and then collapsed into the ashes of history. I want to ask, what did they have in common? What led to their fall and what did it feel like to be a person alive at the time who witnessed the end of their world? In this episode, I want to look at one of history's most remarkable stories of survival. That's the thousand-year epic of the Byzantine Empire. I want to explore how this civilization suffered the loss of its western half and continued the unbroken legacy of Rome right through the Middle Ages. I want to examine how it formed a bridge between two continents and two ages, before ultimately being crushed between them both. I want to tell the story of how it was that the impregnable walls of Constantinople were finally brought crashing to the ground. Six million years ago, the Mediterranean Sea was a very different place to the cool, dark waters we know today. In those days, our ape-like ancestors hadn't even begun to walk on two legs. But if you were able to go back and see that time, stand on the shores of Greece or Italy, Turkey or North Africa, all you would see before you would be a hellish, dead landscape. The land beneath would drop away for 1,500 meters into a rolling desert of bleak salt flats, broken by lakes of water so salty that if you tried to swim in them, you would float on the surface. For more than 600,000 years, this deep depression in the land had been cut off from the Atlantic Ocean by the movement of the earth's plates. Over the millennia, the seawater that had once filled it had evaporated away, leaving only this harsh, salty land where nothing would grow. But this was all about to change in the most dramatic and apocalyptic way imaginable. This vast, deep basin was separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a thin strip of land only 60 kilometers wide, joining the landmasses of what is today Spain and Morocco. Beyond that, the enormous weight of all the world's water heaved and rocked. As 600 millennia passed by, those Atlantic waves ate away at that narrow strip of rock. The ocean waters ground down those cliffs until this strip of land was only 30 kilometers thick, 15 kilometers, then 5 kilometers.
Then, at some point around 5.3 million years ago, this narrow gate of rock burst apart and the Atlantic Ocean was unleashed into Europe. What followed must have been one of the most impressive and terrifying sights that has ever occurred on Earth. The world's ocean burst into the Mediterranean and thundered in a raging torrent down a series of waterfalls that dropped for more than a kilometer. This channel is thought to have carried more than 200 billion liters of seawater every second or as much water as a thousand Amazon rivers, reaching speeds of up to 90 miles an hour. The waters of the Mediterranean rose as much as 10 meters a day to create a sea 4,000 kilometers end-to-end, or enough to cover the whole of North America from California to North Virginia. This process took perhaps as much as three years, but some researchers believe it could have taken only a few months. The force of these thundering waters caused earthquakes and landslides that can be seen in the geological record. These triggered mega-tsunamis more than a hundred meters high, or enough to completely swallow a 30-story building. This deluge is known today as the Zanclean Flood, and it's in this violence that the peaceful sea we call the Mediterranean was formed. This was a body of water quite unlike anywhere else on earth, a vast inland sea now joined to the open ocean by a narrow channel only 8 kilometers across at the Straits of Gibraltar. Europe and Africa were now two separate landmasses, and the formation of this sea would have an immense impact on the shape and history of this region. Geological fragments found in the Apidema Cave in Greece show that modern humans arrived at the Mediterranean around 200,000 years ago, spreading out from Africa along its eastern coast. These early arrivals were initially outcompeted by Neanderthals, a species of archaic humans well-adapted to life in the cold climate of Europe. But over the next hundred millennia, modern humans spread out of Africa in ever-greater numbers. They gradually pushed the Neanderthals out into the fringes of Europe, and ultimately to extinction. When the last ice age ended, the climate of Europe warmed. The glaciers that had covered much of its northern regions disappeared, and humans spread all the way around this vast inland sea. Ice ages rose and fell here through the Bronze Age, but from about the year 530 BC, one city on the shore of this sea had been steadily growing in size and influence. It sat on a temperate peninsula jutting out into the Mediterranean, and its people referred to its waters as Mare Magnum, or the Great Sea. This city was called Rome, and it would build an empire that would last in some form for more than 2,000 years. Rome succeeded because it excelled at organization, mass production, and military expansion. By the year 220 BC, its armies, armed with iron weapons and covering their bodies with iron chainmail or scales, had conquered all of the peninsula of Italy and the islands of Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia. By 140 BC, they had spilled out into the Iberian Peninsula, what is now Spain, and crossed the sea to conquer the ancient cities of Greece. The Romans found a way of expanding their territory that was financially self-sustaining. As more peoples were conquered, they provided the economic base for even further expansion. In 167 BC, the Romans captured the Macedonian treasury, and as a result, they were able to virtually abolish taxes in Rome. When they conquered Pergamon in the year 130 AD, their state budget doubled, and it nearly doubled again after the conquest of Syria.
during this time seemed as inevitable as the rushing torrents of water that had once poured through the Straits of Gibraltar. By the year 70 AD, the entire Mediterranean had been completely surrounded by its vast empire. Rome now stretched from the snowy hills of Scotland in the north to the rolling sand dunes of the Sahara in the south, from the stony shore of the Atlantic in the west to the deserts of Arabia in the east. The Romans and their subject peoples built roads and postal stations, scattering their empire with public baths and theaters, and ushering in a new age of technological development. But they also ruthlessly exploited the lands they conquered and exterminated any who resisted them with extreme cruelty. In the second century, five great emperors ruled, among them the emperors Trajan, Hadrian, and Marcus Aurelius. While wars went on at Rome's borders, a period of peace and prosperity reigned within its lands. But this age of relative peace wasn't to last, and the first signs of this empire crumbling came in the form of a devastating plague. In the winter of the year 165, Rome was at war with the Parthian Empire, a power centered in ancient Iran. Roman troops were besieging the Parthian city of Seleucia, close to modern city of Baghdad, when they first began to experience strange symptoms. The Greek physician Galen describes these frightening occurrences. On the ninth day, a young man had a slight cough. On the tenth day, the cough became stronger and with it he brought up scabs. After having quitar for many days, first with a cough, he brought up a little bright, fresh blood, and afterwards even part of the membrane which lines the artery and rises through the larynx to the mouth. This terrifying new illness spread rapidly through the troops. We don't know exactly what this plague was, but by its description, it may have been smallpox, possibly combined with a simultaneous outbreak of measles. Whatever it was, the plague quickly spread up the rivers of Mesopotamia. In the city of Amida, where the Romans were trying to fight off a Parthian siege, the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus describes the horrific scenes. In the city, where the number of the corpses scattered over the streets was too great for anyone to perform the funeral rites over them, a pestilence was soon added to the other calamities of the citizens, the carcasses becoming full of worms and corruption from the evaporation caused by the heat and the various diseases of the people. Unable to fight both the Parthians and the disease, these Roman soldiers soon returned home. But they would unwittingly lead that invisible enemy right into the heart of the empire. The plague soon spread among the Roman soldiers, stationed among the foggy pine forests on the Rhine River, and then spread south along trade routes, finally reaching the densely packed metropolis of Rome. The Assyrian writer Lucian of Samosata writes about the houses of Rome standing empty with magical symbols and spells painted on their doors to ward off the evil that stalked the city streets. The records of the Han Dynasty in China also record a period of plague breaking out around the same time, suggesting a worldwide pandemic of deadly proportions. This outbreak, known to history as the Antonine Plague, is thought to have killed somewhere in the region of two percent of the empire's population, or around two million people. But in the worst-affected areas, mortality seems to have reached 30 or 40 percent. This weakened the empire at a crucial time in its history. Industries like trade by sea were utterly devastated, and the Roman military was critically weakened. As the plague reached its height, Rome's political world fell apart, too. As the dead littered its streets, the violent
and selfish Emperor Commodus was crowned, and the long history of Rome's decline began. Soon, rival generals fought viciously over who would rule, burning cities to the ground and expending the empire's energy in pointless, self-destructive wars. By the end of the third century, the vast Mediterranean empire could no longer be ruled from the declining city that had given birth to it. Rome was crippled by corruption and its people increasingly suffered from a disease that the Romans believed was caused by bad air, or mal aria in Latin, which we know today as malaria. In a desperate bid to get the empire back on course and end the civil wars, in the year 285, the Emperor Diocletian ordered that Rome's territory be split almost exactly in two. Western Europe and Western North Africa would form the western half of the empire, with its capital at Mediolanum or modern Milan. Meanwhile, the eastern regions, including the modern territories of Greece, Turkey, Syria, Israel, and Egypt, would pass to a new entity which today we call the Eastern Roman Empire. Both halves of the empire would be governed by two rulers each, creating a system known as the Tetrarchy, or the Rule of Four. It was thought that this division of power would finally end the brutal civil wars that had hollowed out the empire from within, but this would not turn out to be the case. The Tetrarchy soon fell apart, and civil war once more rocked the empire, a devastating 20-year conflict that saw the Emperor Constantine fight with his rivals over who would rule. During these wars, Constantine made the remarkable decision to convert to Christianity. This was a young religion based around the worship of a Jewish rebel protesting against the Roman occupation of Jerusalem, and this young faith had long faced brutal repression by Roman authorities. Constantine beat back his rivals and once more united the divided empire, ruling over it as the sole emperor and instating Christianity as its official religion. Constantine was also to embark on what to some must have seemed like an even more remarkable decision. Constantine decided to construct a new capital in the east. He considered various options but ultimately settled on a city that sat at the point right where Europe and Asia met, a small Greek trading city in the far east of the Mediterranean. This was a city known to the Greeks as Byzantion, but the Latin Constantine would have called it by the name we recognize today, Byzantium. The vast Zanclean flood that filled the Mediterranean wasn't the only great inundation to rock this region in prehistory. In fact, on the eastern shore of that sea, around what is now Turkey, another very similar event would take place, on a smaller scale but still no less dramatic. Around seven and a half thousand years ago, it's believed that the waters of the Mediterranean were themselves pushing up against another range of cliffs that walled off a narrow valley known as the Bosphorus. Beyond this barrier was another depression in the land, filled with a large freshwater lake. As the Ice Age ended and the glaciers melted, global sea levels rose, and perhaps aided by the frequent earthquakes in this region, the dam holding back the seas once again broke and the waters of the Mediterranean spilled through the valley of the Bosphorus in vast and unstoppable quantities. If this hypothesis is correct, it's thought that up to 50 cubic kilometers of water poured over this ledge each day, or 200 times the flow of the Niagara Falls. The lands beyond filled with salty seawater, flooding an area of a hundred thousand square kilometers, or about the size of Cuba. It's thought that Stone Age people would have witnessed this flood.
flood, and it must have been a terrifying sight, one that they would tell their children about, and their children's children. In fact, along with the flooding of the Persian Gulf around the same time, this event has been proposed as one source for the biblical story of Noah's flood. This body of water would become known as the Black Sea. Today, its shores belong to the nations of Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey. That narrow valley through which this vast flood of water poured is now a narrow sea channel which we call the Bosphorus. Here, the continents of Asia and Europe are separated by only about 750 meters of sea at their narrowest point. A second narrow channel known as the Dardanelles sits nearly 300 kilometers to the west, where once the ancient city of Troy stood as a rival to the Bronze Age city- states of Greece. Between these two thin entryways is the world's smallest sea, known as the Sea of Marmara. It's right here that the city of Byzantium was founded. Byzantium was an ancient Greek colony founded by settlers from the powerful port city of Megara around the year 667 BC. Folklore attributes the founding of the city to a prince of Megara named Byzas, and the inspiration for Byzas' journey came from the oracle at Delphi. Modern analysis has shown that this oracle was built at a place where volcanic gases were vented from the earth through cracks in the planet's crust. The priestesses of this oracle would descend into chambers flooded with these gases, which would send them into a trance-like, hallucinatory state, ready to give prophecies to those who asked for them. According to this piece of folklore, the oracle at Delphi gave Prince Byzas a haunting piece of advice. You must set sail and search for the land opposite the city of the blind. So, Byzas sailed across the sea, through the narrow Dardanelles Strait, and into the Sea of Marmara. There, he saw what he was looking for. On the Asian side of the sea, a Greek colony named Chalcedon had been established. But Byzas saw immediately that the European side of the sea was a much better place for a colony, a defensible position with a large natural harbor. The settlers of Chalcedon had been blind to miss this perfect spot, and so Byzas had found the land opposite the city of the blind. He landed on the shore and named the city he founded there Byzantion after himself. The advantages that Byzas saw in the city were indeed formidable. It sat right at the narrowest point of the Bosphorus Strait, the point where Asia was less than a kilometer away over the water. This was a natural crossing point, controlling all the land-based trade that ferried between the continents, but it also controlled all shipping traffic that passed between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. On top of this, the swift currents that flowed through the narrow channel would make it very difficult for any army to attack by sea. The city's harbor was a long sliver of a river estuary, sheltered from the swift ocean currents and large enough to hold a thousand ships. This body of water would come to be known as the Golden Horn, either because of the enormous wealth that would flow through it in the ages to come, or for the rich yellow light that would often blaze on its surface as the sun set over the sea. Pinched between the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara, Byzantion was a perfect wedge shape. Any attackers who wanted to take the city were able to approach from only a single direction, and it was a perfect spot to build a fortress that would be virtually unassailable. For much of its early history, Byzantium was not a major city, although it was a wealthy one. No more than
40,000 people are thought to have lived The Roman geographer Strabo writes about the rich stocks of fish that could every year be brought out of the narrow channel of the Bosphorus. The horn, which is close to the Byzantian city wall, resembles a stag's horn. Into these young fish stray and then are easily caught because of their number and the force of the current and the narrowness of the inlets. They are so tightly confined that they are even caught by hand, providing the Byzantines and the Roman people with a considerable income. But despite its natural defensibility, Byzantium was conquered a number of times by the Persian Empire and the Spartan and Athenian Greeks. It was even besieged and burned to the ground by the ruthless Roman Emperor Septimius Severus during one of the empire's more destructive civil wars. When the Emperor Diocletian split the empire in two, Byzantium was chosen to be the capital of the eastern half. Finally, in the year 330 AD, it was chosen to be the new imperial capital of the entire Roman Empire under the Emperor Constantine, as he writes in this 4th century decree. We have resolved that it is fitting that my rule and the power of my kingdom be transferred and transmuted to the regions of the east, and that in the province of Byzantia, on an excellent site, a city be built in my name and my rule be established there. Like the ancient explorer Byzas, Constantine saw his own reflection in this golden city. He renamed Byzantium after himself, calling it Constantinopolis or the City of Constantine, and today we know it as Constantinople. During this time, the city was also known by the informal title Nova Roma or the New Rome. In his new capital, Constantine immediately began an enormous building project with the goal of turning Constantinople into a city worthy of its empire. Constantine laid out a new square at the center of old Byzantium, naming it the Augustaeum, with a new senate house in a grand basilica on the east side, while on the south side, the great palace of the emperor rose. The Byzantine poet Marianus wrote about the beauty of the city in these early days. Where the land is cut in two by the winding channel, whose shores open the way to the sea, our divine emperor erected this palace. O far-ruling Rome, you look from Europe at a prospect in Asia, the beauty of which is worthy of you. Near to the imperial palace was the vast hippodrome used for chariot races. Its track was 450 meters long, with stands capable of holding up to 100,000 spectators. Up to eight chariots could race on its track at one time, each powered by four horses each. These events must have been an electric spectacle. Nearby was the famed baths of Xoixipas, adorned with opulent mosaics. The 5th century writer Leontius writes one invitation to a friend that gives a glimpse of the leisurely life of this city. On one side I have close by me the Xoixipas, a pleasant bath, and on the other the racecourse. After seeing the races at the latter and taking a bath in the former, come and rest at my hospitable table. Then, in the afternoon, you will be in plenty of time for the other races, reaching the course from your room quite near at hand. Constantinople would even create its own obelisk to adorn its hippodrome, built of square stone blocks to a height of 32 meters tall. That's exactly the same height as the obelisk that decorates the Circus Maximus in Rome. This was a statement of clear intent, that Constantinople was every bit the equal of the eternal city. Around the year 330, Constantine also built an imposing city wall.
running between the Golden Horn and the head-shaped city and taking full advantage of its defensible shape. The first Christian Emperor claimed that an angel had guided him about where to place the walls and he built them a great distance from where the old city walls had been, an impressive statement about how large he expected his new capital to grow. And he was right. In the next century Byzantium would grow at an immense rate and by the beginning of the 5th century, the city had spilled out even beyond Constantine's ambitions. Today, we can trace the expansion of the city in the advancing rings of its city walls, growing outwards like the rings of a tree. By the year 404, the Emperor in the east, a man named Theodosius II, embarked on an even more ambitious building project to protect the expanding city and build a new set of walls two kilometers to the west. These would stretch for 6.5 kilometers and massively increase the enclosed area of the city. But while these walls demonstrate the ambition of this expanding city, they also testify to the increasingly dangerous world that the young capital found itself at the heart of. When you look at the situation that the Emperor Theodosius faced at the time he embarked on the building of these walls, it's not hard to see why he considered them necessary. Around this time, vast migrations of people had been pushed out of the Eurasian steppes by some unknown force and were now crossing en masse into Roman lands. The Roman state, crippled by civil war, was struggling to cope. One writer, Synesius, summed up the mood of impending doom in a speech he gave to the Emperor Arcadius around the year 399. Everything balances on a razor's edge and the state needs the assistance of God and the Emperor to crush that danger which has been troubling the Roman Empire for so long. Two years into his reign, in the year 410 AD, the Emperor Theodosius received news of an unthinkable tragedy. An army of Goths, led by the general Alaric, had laid siege to the great city of Rome three times. On the third time, they had burst over its walls and sacked the city. While the sack of Rome was relatively constrained by the standards of the time, it was still an act that shocked the world. The writer Saint Melanius the Younger, writing about ten years later, describes this horrifying event. A barbarian storm of which prophecies long ago spoke fell upon Rome, and it did not even spare the bronze statues in the forum. Plundering with barbarian madness, it destroyed everything. Thus, Rome, beautified for 1,200 years, became a ruin. The writer Saint Jerome, a native of the Western Empire then living in Bethlehem, wrote a passionate outburst of sorrow at the news. Oh, horrid! The universe tumbles and yet our sins do not fall. A renowned city and head of the Roman Empire is consumed in one blaze. The disaster sent refugees from Rome fleeing across the Mediterranean, piled into boats. They landed on the shores of Africa, Egypt, and the East. Saint Jerome describes the desperate plight of these citizens. Who would believe that Rome, built up by the conquest of the whole world, had collapsed, that the mother of nations had become also their tomb, that the shores of the whole East, of Egypt, of Africa which once belonged to the imperial city, were filled with the hosts of her menservants and maidservants. Wherever the Roman refugees landed, piled into boats, starving and thirsty, the people their fine clothes and thought they must be carrying some hidden wealth on them, as Saint Jerome remembers. Who would have believed that mighty Rome, with its careless security of wealth, would be reduced to such extremities as to need shelter.
food and clothing. Some are so hard-hearted and cruel that instead of showing compassion, they break up the rags and bundles of the captives and expect to find gold on those who are nothing more than prisoners. The emperor Theodosius was determined that his city of Constantinople would not follow the fate of Rome, and so the walls he built in the following years would be one of the most imposing defensive structures ever to be built in either the ancient or the medieval worlds. This was a ring of three walls, arranged one after the other, each taller than the last, with a wide moat in front of them. This moat could be immediately flooded on demand using an ingenious system of pipes that ran along the length of the walls, providing instant defense should the city be threatened. The final tallest wall was almost five meters thick and 12 meters high, including 96 towers each at a height of 20 meters. These walls were built with precisely cut blocks of white limestone and decorated with lines of red brick, so that they must have shone a gleaming white when the sun hit them. These walls were so formidable that they would not be breached for a thousand years, and it would take a complete revolution in military technology to do so. These walls were not completed a moment too soon. In fact, as the final stones were being put into place, they would face one of the most fearsome tests that could be imagined. That's because in the decades since the first barbarian migrations had begun, it had become apparent what was driving so many nomadic people out of Asia. That force was a people known as the Huns, and they would soon be ruled by a man whose shadow would loom over all of Europe. His predecessors had united the nomadic peoples of the Russian steppes into a terrifying force, and he would lead them west in a campaign of destruction that would have few equals. That man's name was Attila. The Huns were a nomadic people who lived in Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Eastern Europe. They were a society of pastoral warriors, living mostly from the meat and milk provided by the animals they herded. At first, they had mostly held back from Roman territory. The Romans even employed them as mercenaries, happily paying them to keep clear of its territory. But with the rise of Attila, all of that was about to change. The 5th century Byzantine historian Priscus of Panium describes Attila in the following terms. He was a man born into the world to shake the nations, the scourge of all lands, who terrified all mankind. He was haughty in his walk, rolling his eyes hither and thither, so that the power of his proud spirit appeared in the movement of his body. He was indeed a lover of war. When Attila became king of the Huns, he was determined to set out on an aggressive policy of expansion into Roman lands. He broke treaties he'd formerly kept with the Romans and began to raid their cities. The Roman army, weakened by all of the empire's troubles, could do little to repel him. Attila conquered territory throughout Gaul and into modern France, establishing a vast Hunnic empire across Eastern and Central Europe. In the year 447, he marched his armies across the Danube and into the Eastern Roman Empire. The Eastern Romans were immediately overwhelmed. All along the border, their forts burned, pillars of smoke black in the sky. Now, the armies of Attila bore down on the center of their world, their capital, the great city of Constantinople itself. The Byzantine monk Callinicus, in his work The Life of Saint Hypatius, wrote about the dire situation that now faced the new capital. The barbarian nation of the Huns, which was in Thrace, became so great that more than a hundred cities were captured. There were so many murders and blood lettings that the
dead could not be numbered, for they took captive the churches and monasteries and slew the monks and maidens in great numbers. And to make matters worse, the formidable walls of Constantinople could no longer be relied on. In January of the year 447, the ground shook with a terrifying force. This earthquake was the strongest in living memory, perhaps in all of the city's history. Over a period of four months, earthquakes and the floods they caused ravaged the whole area with enormous loss of life. Buildings collapsed across Constantinople. The city's skyline must have been pocked and broken by fallen roofs and crumbling walls, and people were buried in the rubble. But most terrifying of all, the tremors brought down a whole section of the great Theodosian Walls, the only thing standing between the people of the city and the approaching army of the Huns. For the citizens of Constantinople, this must have been utterly terrifying. These walls had taken more than nine years to build, and now one man was put in charge of the seemingly impossible task of repairing them in only a few months. He was a prefect and a native of the lands of Phrygia in modern Turkey, and his name was Constantinus. Constantinus was new in his post and he had an enormous task ahead of him. But he also knew that his city had one great untapped resource, that is, its immense spirit of competition. Constantinus went down to the city's vast hippodrome or racetrack. Over the century or so since its renovation by the Emperor Constantine, it had become the most important hub of the city's social life. Chariot racing in Byzantium held people's fanatic devotion in a similar way to football today. Just like football, chariot racing had become a big money business. Four great racing teams raced in the sands of the hippodrome, each named after a color, the reds, blues, greens, and whites. Each of these was supported by and closely tied to a political party in the Byzantine Senate. Just like our modern sports teams today, bitter rivalries existed between these teams and their legions of supporters. Riots were common events at the racecourse and it was not uncommon for deaths to occur when rival gangs of these hooligans met. Constantinus arrived at the hippodrome that morning, perhaps shaking a little at the magnitude of the task he faced. He raised his hands and made a simple announcement to the gangs of racing fans he found there. The city was in danger. These sports teams were to help with the reconstruction of the city walls. They would each be given a section to complete and they had to gather as many of their supporters to help as they could. The declaration of a competition was clear and irresistible. These gangs went about the city's drinking places and squares, its baths and spice markets, gathering as many people as they could from the streets, telling them that the pride of their team was at stake, and also, perhaps as an afterthought to some of them, the fate of their city. In this way, more than 16,000 workers were gathered to repair the walls of Constantinople. We can imagine the frenzy of activity as these masses of sports fans climbed the scaffolding with stones, bricks, and mortar, singing their team songs and jeering at the other teams as together they rebuilt their fallen walls. This effort was so effective that in only two months, the walls of the city were rebuilt and even reinforced in some places. A brief inscription carved into the base of the walls is all the monument that was left to this remarkable achievement, comparing it to the mythological figure Pallas, the titan of war. By command of Theodosius, in less than two months Constantinus erected triumphantly these strong walls. Scarcely could Pallas have built so quickly.
quickly so strong a citadel. We can imagine the look on the face of Artilla when he arrived at the gates of Constantinople and found not the earthquake-crumbled ruin that he had been promised, but a triple line of defensive walls, their limestone glistening white in the sun, the strongest fortification in the known world. The two sides reached a stalemate. Artilla could not take the city but the Byzantines could not beat him in battle. Eventually, a treaty was signed. The Romans agreed to increase their payments to the Huns and Artilla left the lands of Byzantium. Constantinople was saved and the Eastern Roman Empire would survive. But for its sister power, the Western Roman Empire, the pressures raining down on it would prove too much. As the 5th century progressed, one side of the empire would stand while the other would crumble into the earth. The landscapes of Byzantium ranged across two continents and over an enormous variation in temperatures and climates. These lands had always been the most populous of all the lands of Rome, the richest and the best developed. In fact, by the late empire, its eastern half had a budget three times the size of the west and an army twice as large. In Europe, the heart of the Eastern Empire was always the Balkans, including Greece. In Asia, it was the region known as Anatolia or Asia Minor, which is roughly the area of modern Turkey. The empire's European territories included parts of modern Greece, Albania, Macedonia, and Bulgaria. Here, craggy mountains covered by dense forest divide this area into steep river valleys that drain into the Adriatic, Aegean, and Mediterranean seas. The most fertile regions here are along the Danube, Europe's second-longest river. The temperate regions of the north have a very similar climate to northern Europe, and on the coast, grains and vegetables can be grown, along with fruit trees like apples, cherries, figs, pears, and pomegranates. Olive trees are grown here in great numbers, surviving well on the rocky soil. Inland, there are terraced vineyards and orchards, while the higher mountain regions are used for herding goats and sheep. Across the narrow channel of the Bosphorus is Anatolia, again, around the region of modern Turkey. In the west, the earth here rises gently out of the Aegean Sea and forms a fertile coastal plain where the Greeks once founded city-state colonies. But in the north and south, huge mountains loom, among them the range known as the Taurus. These form an almost unbroken wall along the length of southern Turkey, and they're broken only by the famed Silesian Gates, a path through the rocky hills along a narrow gorge that in ancient times took about five days to cross, leading travelers out of Anatolia and into Syria. In Byzantine times, much of this land wasn't suitable for crop production, but the sloping plateaus of Anatolia were perfect for raising vast pastures. Medieval writers regularly mention the enormous herds of cattle, goats, and sheep that roamed here. Despite the administrative division of the empire, the Romans of the time didn't consider their empire to have been split. For much of their shared history, the Romans of both halves went on viewing it as a single entity, although governed by two different imperial courts. But there were significant differences between the two halves. The overwhelming culture of the east was Greek, and the Byzantines spoke the Greek language throughout the empire's history, in contrast to Western Rome which spoke Latin. But the people of the Byzantine Empire never referred to themselves as Greek. Even the name Byzantine is a much later invention. In fact,
until the end of their history, right they refer to themselves simply as Romans and their lands Byzantine rulers were in fact greatly offended whenever westerners referred to them as the emperor of the Greeks the people of Constantinople viewed their city and the city of Rome as what the Byzantine philosopher Themistius to mother cities although of course he argues that Constantinople deserves just a little more credit since it had to build itself up from nothing and yet of the two mother cities of the world that of Romulus and that of Constantine it is ours I would say that is in greater harmony for she had no association with the race of rulers and yet she became a partner in empire with the great city through her virtue In the year 381, the theologian and archbishop of Constantinople Gregory Nazianson wrote about how these two cities seemed like a light to the world nature has not given us two suns but it has given two Roms, beacons of the whole world one an ancient power and one a new differing from each other only to this extent that the one outshines the sun the other the evening star but they hold a beauty to match beauty a balanced pair So, it's hard to imagine how it must have felt during this time to be a citizen of Constantinople and to hear stories about what was happening in the west. While the administration of the emperor's court had moved elsewhere in the 4th century, the city of Rome was still the symbolic heart of a powerful empire and the home of an immensely rich aristocracy with estates all over the Mediterranean but as the 5th century dawned, its position began to falter. Only 45 years after the destruction of the city by Alaric, a second sacking of the city by the vandals once again halved its population and by  Rome's influence extended no further than the borders of the Italian Peninsula. Despite its claims, wealth no longer flowed to it from the rest of its empire and the complex economic web it sat at the heart of began to unravel. We can see the decline of Rome written in the stones of its buildings. One example is the massive Basilica Emilia, which stood next to the Senate House. It was destroyed by fire sometime in the 5th century, possibly during one of the sacks of the city, and while the Romans rebuilt its outside facade, making sure it looked suitably grand to onlookers, they never repaired its interior. This building presented a grand face to the world, while inside it was a burned-out shell. By this time, the same could be said for the whole city of Rome and the western part of its empire. Excavations have shown that by the mid- 5th century, rubbish was being dumped within Rome's great monumental buildings, that the buildings themselves were beginning to crumble, and that new, rough paths were being cut by people walking and dragging carts and horses through its fine gardens and monuments. By the 470s, the Roman emperor in the west, who now ruled from the city of Ravenna, was little more than an Italian warlord. Rome could no longer pay to maintain its legions and increasingly relied on the services of German mercenaries. Eventually, they could no longer pay these either, and when one group of mercenaries known as the Heruli demanded lands in Italy as payment, the Romans refused. The Heruli rebelled and the remnants of the Roman army was defeated in the Battle of Ravenna in the year 476. The Roman emperor was forced to resign and the western empire vanished as a political entity entirely. Rome's collapse over the 5th century must have sent chills down their spine. The writer Saint Jerome encapsulates what must have been the fear and uncertainty of that age.
What is safe if Rome perishes? But for the most part, life in the east was virtually unaffected by the fall of the west. In fact, Constantinople continued its expansion and rise in importance, becoming now the undisputed capital and center of the Mediterranean world. Throughout the whole period of Rome's collapse, the east was seen as a safe haven and it must have received an influx of refugees fleeing the destruction in the west. One writer, Paulinus of Pella, writes in his work Eucharisticos that he considered leaving the west and heading back to his Byzantine estates in Greece and Albania. His wife ultimately convinced him that the journey would be too dangerous, but we can assume that many did make this trip, swelling the population of the east and its capital of Constantinople. This was the beginning of the city's role as a sanctuary to the destitute, the city that later poets would refer to as the refuge of strangers. A great refuge for strangers, queen of the queens of cities, song of songs and splendor of splendors. Before the Christians of the east, the fall of Rome posed a religious conundrum. The empire had converted to Christianity little more than a century earlier, and now destruction was raining down on it from all sides. Many back in Rome believed that this was a punishment for abandoning their ancient pagan gods, but Christian scholars in the east were busy arguing that it was just these remnants of paganism that had brought about the collapse, as the writer Nihilus describes. You have said that hordes of barbarians have often invaded Romania because everyone was not willing or eager to worship the pagan gods with sacrifices. No, however, something more distinct and unveiled. Inroads of the barbarians, earthquakes, conflagrations, and all other grievous things are occurring for no other reason than the wickedness and foolishness of the superstitious and impious men among you who have not ceased your idolatry but continue to sacrifice to worthless deities every day in the suburbs. The eastern half of the empire endured the tremors of the fifth century well. It suffered some damage from the Hun and Ostrogoth invasions, but it ultimately managed to buy off these attackers. It was plagued by vandal pirates sailing from their bases in North Africa, and nomadic tribes like the Blemyes and Nobadis in Upper Egypt. But these enemies inflicted no permanent damage, and soon one man, an emperor of the east, would go on a crusade to recover the fragmented lands that had once belonged to the western empire. He was one of the most remarkable characters from history, and his name was Justinian. The story of Justinian begins with his uncle, a man named Justin. Justinian was a prime example of one remarkable aspect of Byzantine society, that is, the ability of just about anyone to rise through its ranks and even reach the very pinnacle of imperial power. In fact, Justin began his life as a swineherd in the region of Dardania, a mountainous area in the Balkans next door to Macedonia. As a teenager, he and two of his friends fled the chaos in the west. They crossed the mountain passes in what must have been columns of refugees, with the smoke of their homeland rising in the skies behind them. Everyone in that column had only one name on their lips, the only place in the world that at that moment seemed like a place of safety, the refuge of strangers, the city of Constantinople. The historian Procopius gives one account of this humble journey. Three young farmers of Illyrian origin came from Vederiana, determined to join the army. They covered the whole distance to Byzantium on foot, carrying on their own shoulders cloaks in which on their arrival, they had nothing but twice-baked bread that they backed at home.
When they arrived at the great capital, Constantine spoke Latin but only very simple Greek, and he must have been at sea in the hubbub of different languages spoken in Constantinople. Like most peasants, he was also illiterate, but he managed to secure a place in the palace guard and rose through the ranks of military life to become a tribune and then a senator. Finally, under the emperor Anastasius, he was appointed commander of the palace guard. When the emperor died, as so often happened upon the death of Byzantine emperors, the palace exploded in intrigue. The Grand Chamberlain, a man named Amantius, is said to have given a large amount of money to Justin, intending to buy his support. But Justin took his money and gave it out to numerous other people, ensuring their loyalty to him. When the dust settled, Justin was elected as the new emperor. Justin soon reached out to his peasant family and he brought his young nephew, the boy named Justinian, to the capital to be educated. Justinian was also a peasant, but in Constantinople, he learned jurisprudence, theology, and Roman history. He learned about the greatness of the empire that had once ruled in the west, and about the circumstances of its catastrophic fall. Perhaps it's here that he began to dream of an ambitious and seemingly impossible project. This he would later call the Renovatio Imperii, the restoration of the empire. Justinian became emperor after his uncle's death and he set about the job of ruling with enormous energy. He became known as the emperor who never sleeps, but his reign was not without controversy. He married a lower-class woman named Theodora, a courtesan with a lascivious reputation, and this caused great scandal across the empire. The contradictory and contrasting ways that Justinian has been portrayed are nowhere better shown than in the writings of the scholar Procopius. Early in his life, Procopius writes about Justinian and Theodora as a pious and dedicated couple. But later, he also wrote another text entitled The Anecdota. This was a scandalous tell-all about the true Justinian and Theodora, a text that has come to be known as the Secret History. In his Anecdota, Procopius portrays the emperor Justinian as a cruel, incompetent ruler. He committed numberless murders through his notion of piety, for in his zeal to bring all men to agree in one form of Christian doctrine, he recklessly murdered all who dissented therefrom under the pretext of piety, for he did not think that it was murder if those whom he slew were not of the same belief as himself. Procopius even goes so far as to claim that Justinian and his wife had been possessed by evil spirits, and recounts tales of them wandering the palace without their heads. Some of those who have been with Justinian at the palace late at night, men who were pure of spirit, have thought they saw a strange, demoniac form taking his place. One man said that the emperor suddenly rose from his throne and walked about, and immediately Justinian's head vanished while the rest of his body seemed to ebb and flow, whereat the beholder stood aghast and fearful, wondering if his eyes were deceiving him. Justinian's reign was also marred with riots. In the year 532, the famous chariot-racing factions of Constantinople, those rival gangs who had helped to rebuild the city's walls against the advance of Attila, joined forces once again to rise up in the streets against what they saw as the corruption of Justinian's rule. They marched through the streets of the capital, setting fire to the city and chanting the word nika, nika, the Greek word for victory. These riots became known as the Nika Riots, and they were so severe that the emperor considered fleeing by sea. During the riots, the old church that had stood on the hill beside the imperial palace burned to the ground.
Justinian's reaction was brutal. crushing of the riots by the army. Procopius records that 30,000 citizens of Constantinople were killed during this repression and the sands of the Hippodrome were stained with their blood. Whatever the truth of Justinian's character, we can at least be certain that he was ambitious. In the wake of the riots, he resolved to rebuild the city and in the blackened ruin of the old church, he ordered plans to be drawn up for a new cathedral that would rival Saint Peter's tomb in Rome. What resulted was one of the world's most remarkable buildings. Columns and other marbles were brought from all over the empire and more than 10,000 people were employed in its construction. Its vast dome rises 55 meters above the ground, with a span of 30 meters. This is the Church of Saint Sophia, more commonly known by its Greek name, the Hagia Sophia, and today it's one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. Justinian was also determined to increase the economic potential of his empire. One of the ways he did this was through perhaps history's first act of corporate espionage. That's the theft of the secret of silk from China. As we discovered in the last episode, for centuries, silk had been the sole reserve of Chinese craftsmen. The product of their silkworms had spread throughout the world long before any diplomatic contact with China was established. But in the year 551, two Byzantine monks who had been preaching in India made their way to China and observed the intricate methods used in the raising of silkworms and the production of silk. They hurried back to Constantinople and sought an urgent audience with the Emperor Justinian. They told him that they had found the source of the miracle material, silk, and the emperor was impressed. He offered them a great fortune if they were able to smuggle some of these mysterious worms back to the capital. The monks set out once again, likely traveling along a northern route along the Black Sea. They would have passed through the Tarim Basin and the Taklamakan Desert, through the Gate of Jade, and down the Hexi Corridor into the heartlands of China. With them, they carried bamboo canes, hollowed out on the inside with hidden compartments. In China, they convinced others to smuggle the silkworms out for them, likely in the form of eggs or very young larvae, since adult silkworms are very delicate and easily killed by temperature variations. The entire expedition may have taken up to two years, but they eventually returned successful and established a breeding population of silkworms on the other end of the Silk Road. Their actions began a Byzantine trade in silk, with silk factories setting up in Constantinople as well as Beirut, Antioch, and Thebes. The Byzantine Empire quickly established a monopoly on silk in Europe, and this formed one of the bases for their economy throughout the medieval period, swelling the wealth of Byzantium to unprecedented size. By the early 6th century, the city of Constantinople was unmatched around Europe. It had constructed the longest aqueduct in the ancient world, winding for around 250 kilometers through the countryside. The early emperors had also supplemented the city's defenses with another series of defensive walls more than 60 kilometers from the capital, known as the Long Walls. These stretched 56 kilometers from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara. But the Emperor Justinian had even greater ambitions. He wanted to recover all the lands of the Western Roman Empire and restore Rome to its ancient size, and he would be incredibly successful. Justinian never took part in the military campaigns he ordered. He left them.
that to a talented general named Belisarius. From his throne in Constantinople, Justinian watched as the lands of Old Rome fell once more under his banner. The general Belisarius marched across North Africa and conquered the Vandals who still occupied it in only nine months. Then he set his sights on Italy, where an Ostrogoth king still ruled. Belisarius swept into Italy and laid siege to Rome itself, encircling it for over a year, and finally marching through its gates in the year 536. When Belisarius marched into the city of Rome, he would have seen a place much faded from the greatness of its past. Two large earthquakes in the 5th century had damaged many of its great buildings, but its aqueducts were still running and its baths still functioned. Gladiators and animals still fought in its Colosseum, and a threadbare population had begun to reclaim some of their importance in the region, if nothing like the European Empire they had once ruled. For the Emperor Justinian and Belisarius, Rome was the ultimate symbol of the revitalized empire, and they would not give it up for anything. The Ostrogoth king who ruled over Italy, a man named Vitigas, quickly responded, marching on Rome with an army of his own. Now it was the turn of Belisarius to be under siege. The Ostrogoth king offered him and his men safe passage if he left the city in peace, and Belisarius responded with this reply. It was you who trespassed upon this city in former times, though it did not belong to you at all. Now you have given it back, however unwillingly, to its ancient possessors. Whoever of you has hopes of setting foot in Rome without a fight is mistaken. For as long as Belisarius lives, it is impossible for him to relinquish this city. Ultimately, the Romans succeeded in holding the city. But this was only the beginning of a long and costly series of wars in Italy. In the years that followed, the city of Rome would be besieged and captured a further three times, each time more brutally and more costly than the last. But finally, the Ostrogoth hold on Italy collapsed, and the Byzantine Empire reclaimed the eternal city for the Empire of Rome. But there was a tragic irony to this situation. In trying to return Rome to its empire, the Byzantines had done immense damage to the city. In the wars of Belisarius, perhaps as many as 90% of all Rome's citizens had either been killed or fled the city, leaving a population of perhaps only 30,000 people. The inhabited area of the city was reduced to only a tenth of its previous size. Of the 13 great aqueducts that had once carried water directly into the city, only two remained in operation. If there had ever been hope of Rome rebuilding the glory of its ancient past, then the Byzantines had ended that hope forever. The conquests of Justinian, though remarkable as achievements in themselves, were short-lived. The Byzantine Empire simply didn't have the resources to maintain such a large territory for any period of time. The Gothic Wars drained its wealth and distracted its military. In the 540s, another plague spread throughout Europe, weakening it even further. The so-called Plague of Justinian may have killed anywhere between 25 to 100 million people over the next two centuries. Modern science has confirmed that it was caused by a strain of the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the same organism that caused the Black Death in medieval Europe. The outbreak in Constantinople is thought to have been carried to the city by infected rats on grain ships arriving from Egypt. The Emperor Justinian is even reported to have contracted the disease, although he was one of the approximately 50% of the infected.
of people who would recover. Procopius records that at its peak, the plague was killing 10,000 people in Constantinople every day, and of course, he blames Justinian for its arrival. The plague began to rage and swept away nearly half the survivors. Such were the disasters that afflicted mankind from the day when Justinian first commenced to manage the affairs of the kingdom, and after he had ascended the imperial throne. Procopius also reserves harsh words for the way Justinian reacted in the face of this plague, and his unwillingness to offer support to the stricken peasants of the empire. When pestilence swept through the whole known world, and notably the Roman Empire, wiping out most of the farming community and of necessity leaving a trail of desolation in its wake, Justinian showed no mercy towards the ruined freeholders. Even then, he did not refrain from demanding the annual tax. The plague weakened the Byzantine Empire at a critical point when Justinian's armies had nearly retaken all of Italy and the western Mediterranean coast. Soon, the Germanic people known as the Lombards invaded northern Italy, defeated the small Byzantine army left there, and established their own kingdom. The dream of resurrecting the ancient empire was dead. In the 550s, two earthquakes shook the capital of Constantinople and in an event that seemed redolent with symbolism, the Great Dome of the Hagia Sophia cracked. In the year 558, a final earthquake caused the dome to collapse entirely. To the citizens of Constantinople, this devastating event must have seemed like the final judgment of God on an emperor who had such lofty ambitions but had in the end fallen so short. Justinian died in the year 565, having left no children. He was buried in a grand mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Apostles. The emperors who followed after him would reap the consequences of his over-ambitious conquests. Justinian had inherited an imperial treasury of 29 million gold coins, but his wars had all but emptied it. In the east, Byzantium was now under pressure from the powerful Sassanid Empire, a Persian empire that ruled from the city of Ctesiphon near modern Baghdad. Wars with the Sassanids dragged on for decades, weakening both empires and usually resulting in a bitter and costly stalemate. By the year 630, the empire had lost most of Italy and North Africa once more, and held only a foothold in the island of Sicily. But in the early 7th century, one emperor named Heraclius seemed like he could return the empire to its previous glory. He ruled for 30 years, won an impressive series of battles, and beat the Sassanids back in Anatolia, even recapturing the holy city of Jerusalem. In the year 629, Heraclius brought the relic of the true cross back to the city of Jerusalem in a lavish and triumphant ceremony. For a time, it must have seemed that he was leading the empire to a new golden age. But little did the people of Byzantium know that a new rival was rising out of one of the most unlikely places, the seemingly empty desert sands of Arabia. The Arabian Peninsula is a wedge of land pinched between the Persian Gulf in the north and the Red Sea in the south. It's technically a subcontinent since it sits on its own tectonic plate. Over millions of years, it has torn away from the rest of Africa in the south while slowly crashing into the Eurasian Plate in the north, forcing up Iran's Zagros Mountains. This is an arid land divided between rocky mountains and dry coastland lined with coral reefs and separated by small strips of fertile pastures.
in its rocky valleys. is home to a vast range of deserts. The largest of these, the Great Arabian Desert, is the fifth-largest in the world and one of the deepest. Its sands are thought to extend up to 180 meters below its surface, or more than 50 stories. And it's here that a warrior visionary had risen to topple the established powers of the region and gathered a powerful military force. The man known to history as Muhammad was a revolutionary, a guerrilla warrior, a poet, and an innovative military strategist. And during the final ten years of his life, he led a successful campaign to capture the city of Mecca from the Quraysh tribe who had ruled it for centuries. After his death in the year 632, the successors of Muhammad took up his mantle. To their north, they spread out of the Arabian Peninsula and faced ahead of them the lands of both the Sassanids in Mesopotamia and Persia, and the Byzantines in Egypt. But these two great ancient empires had been hollowed out from within, weakened and bankrupted by their incessant wars. The last great war between these two empires had ended only a few years before, after grinding on for nearly three decades and critically weakening them. The Arab advance came as a complete surprise. The Byzantines were distracted by their wars and paid little heed to news that was trickling across the desert to the south. They had also stopped paying tribute to the desert tribes who they usually relied on to pass them information. In the year 634, to the surprise of the entire world, the Arab armies defeated a Byzantine force sent into Syria and captured Damascus in a lightning strike. The Byzantines tried again in 636 but a sandstorm scattered their forces, and when the Arab cavalry bore down on them, they were utterly annihilated. Arab armies fought using swords made of the finest Indian steel, riding on the backs of camels and horses, versatile and fast across the desert landscape. Their tactics were primarily defensive, luring their opponents into ill-advised attacks, with large groups of archers placed on both flanks. The only hope for the Byzantines was now that their great rivals, the Sassanids, would halt the Arab advance. But this hope would be in vain. In fact, Arab attacks would bring about the complete disintegration and collapse of the Sassanid Empire. Four hundred years later, the Persian poet Firdusi would write the following lament about the end of this great power. Damn this world, damn this time, damn this fate! Where are your valiant warriors and priests? Where are your hunting parties and your feasts? Where is that warlike spirit and where are those great armies that destroyed our country's foes? Count Iran as a ruin, as the lair of lions and leopards. Look now and despair. The Byzantines watched helplessly as their Asian territories were swallowed up. Jerusalem, recaptured less than a decade before at enormous cost, surrendered to Arab armies in the year 637. For the general emperor Heraclius, on whom the Byzantines had pinned such hopes, this catastrophic defeat proved too much. He had once been the commander of his father's fleet, a bold and accomplished sailor. But in his old age, he developed an overwhelming thalassophobia, or fear of the sea. On his way back to Constantinople from Asia, he found even the 700-meter crossing of the Bosphorus too terrifying. His men had to tie boats together across the whole length of the crossing, covering them with shrubs and matting so that the terrified old emperor couldn't see the water, rocking dark and deep beneath him. And Egypt fell to Arab forces in the year 642.
The Byzantine Empire lost its rich food supplies, which had been a major source of grain for the capital. This arrangement had been in place since the time of the ancient Romans and now the entire economic structure of the Byzantine Empire would have to be rearranged overnight. Food shortages were now added to the list of the empire's problems. By 647, the last Byzantine territory in Africa, the ancient city of Carthage, had also fallen to the advancing Arab armies. In the year 644, to the Byzantines' horror, the Arab Empire began building a navy. Only a decade later, it was strong enough to raid the island of Cyprus and Rhodes. Neither island put up even a scrap of resistance and it soon became clear that Byzantium was no longer able to defend its empire. In the year 654, the Emperor Constans personally set sail with the Byzantine Navy, the pride of the empire and its last line of defense, to meet the Arab fleet in battle. The writer Theophanes the Confessor recalls what happened next. In this year, Muawiya commanded that a great naval armament should be made with a view to his fleet sailing against Constantinople. This man arrived at Phoenix in Lycia, where the Emperor Constans lay with the Roman fleet and engaged him in a sea battle. Now, the emperor, who had taken no measures to draw up his battle line, ordered the Roman fleet to fight. When the two sides engaged, the Romans were defeated and the sea was dyed with Roman blood. In the ensuing struggle, 500 Byzantine ships were destroyed. The Emperor Constans was forced to swap clothes with another man and flee in the garb of a common soldier, a stinging humiliation for this emperor of the Byzantines. The emperor then put his robes on another man. This courageous man then stationed himself bravely on the imperial ship and killed many of the enemy before giving up his life on behalf of the emperor. The enemy surrounded him and held him in their midst, thinking he was the emperor. After he had slain many of them, they killed him too as the man was wearing the imperial robes. Thus routed, the emperor escaped and leaving everyone behind, sailed off to Constantinople. The city of Constantinople was now completely defenseless. Now firmly in control of Syria and the Mediterranean coast, Arab armies were able to send frequent raiding parties deep into Anatolia. In the year 674, they felt bold enough to make a strike at the great city, Constantinople itself. The Arab fleet began by capturing port towns along the coast and then setting up a blockade of Constantinople, attempting to choke the life from the city. Theophanes the Confessor recalls these events in his chronicle. In this year in March, a rainbow appeared in the sky and all mankind shuddered. Everyone said it was the end of the world. In this year, the deniers of Christ readied a great expedition. The emperor at the time was named Constantine IV and he must have wondered whether this was finally the end of the empire that had once ruled all of Europe. But the Byzantines had one more trick up their sleeve. In fact, in recent years, they had developed a secret superweapon of terrifying power that would soon become famous around the world. This weapon is so mysterious that today there is still lively debate over what exactly it was. The scholars of Byzantium guarded its secrets so jealously that today its name is synonymous with the Greek Byzantines who developed it. That weapon was Greek fire. Incendiary weapons had been used in warfare for centuries before Greek fire was invented. Flaming arrows and pots containing combustible substances were used by the Assyrians as early as the 9th century BC.
But the substance known as Greek fire was different. It was reportedly developed by a man named Kallinikos who had fled the Arab conquests as a refugee and had been given refuge in the city of Constantinople. This city, which had seen refugees rise to become emperors, now saw the secret of its survival come to it from the midst The medieval writer Anna Komnena gives one account that is thought to describe this terrifying weapon. This fire is made by the following arts. From the pine and the certain such evergreen trees, inflammable resin is collected. This is rubbed with sulfur and put into tubes of reed and is blown by men using it with violent and continuous breath. Then in this manner, it meets the fire on the tip and catches light and falls like a fiery whirlwind on the faces of the enemies. The refugee Kallinikos is said to have demonstrated his Greek fire to the Byzantine emperor. It was a flaming substance, possibly based on petroleum, that seemed to set even the surface of the sea ablaze. Water couldn't douse its flames and by some accounts, even made them more intense. Its use was accompanied with smoke and the sounds of thunder. One remarkable Norse saga relates the story of a Viking warrior named Ingvar the Far-Traveled, a traveler who sailed down the Volga River and into the Caspian Sea to explore the lands of Asia. Ingvar apparently faced ships equipped with Greek fire weaponry, which is described in the saga. They began blowing with smith's bellows at a furnace in which there was fire and there came from it a great din. There stood there also a brass or bronze tube and from it flew much fire against one ship and it burned up in a short time so that all of it had become white ashes. Whatever its exact composition, we know the effect that this weapon had. The writer Theophanes recalls these dramatic events in his chronicle as the ships of the Arab forces bore down on the great city. When Constantine learned of the movement of God's enemies against Constantinople, he prepared huge two-storied warships equipped with Greek fire and siphon-carrying warships, ordering them to anchor in the harbor of the Caesareum. All day long from dawn to dusk there was combat from the outworks of the Golden Gate to Cyclobion. Both sides were thrusting and counter-thrusting, but with the aid of God and his mother they were disgraced, expending a host of warlike men. They retreated in great distress with severe wounds. As their expedition was going away after God had ruined it, it was overtaken by a tempestuous winter storm near Sileon. It was shivered to atoms and completely destroyed. This defeat on sea was coupled with a Byzantine victory on land and the Arab forces withdrew, suffering enormous losses. Growing divisions in their own lands soon forced them to attend to their own affairs and a peace deal was struck. A second siege of Constantinople was attempted at the start of the 8th century, but once again the use of Greek fire drove the enemy armies back into their lands. The Byzantine Empire had survived yet another existential threat and the city of Constantinople remained the impregnable fortress that the Emperor Theodosius had hoped. Over the next few centuries, storm after storm would rage on the city of Constantinople, but it would always hold. Its powerful walls, its natural defenses and the ingenious invention of Greek fire would keep it safe from its enemies in Asia and in Europe. I'm going to fast forward the story now until around the 10th century and pause there for a moment to take a look at what life was like in the Byzantine Empire during this time. For the Byzantine people, the city of Constantinople was a source of
pride. They called it the eye of the world showing the Byzantine crescent moon would have fluttered and snapped over its rooftops. Travelers and pilgrims to the Holy Land usually pass through Constantinople on their route and they have left us vivid accounts of the city's beauty and magnificence. One Russian visitor, Steven of Novgorod, described the city in the following terms. Entering Constantinople is like entering a great forest. It is impossible to get around without a good guide and if you try to get around on the cheap without offering tips, you'll be unable to see or kiss a single saint. Another pilgrim named Foti described the enormous wealth of churches and icon houses around the city. It is impossible to go to all the holy monasteries or holy relics or to recount them. Still, there are thousands upon thousands of relics of saints and many wonders which it is impossible to describe. Foti even witnessed an imperial procession, although he does fall foul of the hands-on approach of some of the Byzantine imperial guards. We set out the next day for the Balacaray Palace. I soon lost my companions in the crowd and stepped up onto the base of a pillar to try and see them. Instead, I caught a glimpse of the imperial family as they entered, splendid in the most luxuriously embroidered golden robes imaginable and wearing golden crowns. As the ceremony started, however, I was rudely knocked off the pillar by some of the imperial guards and sent sprawling onto the stone floor. Some of these may have been part of the famed unit called the Varangian Guards, made up of Viking warriors from Scandinavia. Walking around the city at this time, visitors would have wandered down narrow streets between buildings built from the orange-brown bricks still manufactured with Roman methods. Church bells would have rung out, the singing of somber Byzantine chants from the churches, the calling of seabirds, and the clatter of the wooden shutters in the houses. Countless languages would have been heard on these streets since Constantinople at this time had welcomed people from all over the known world, as one 10th century knight named Bartolth of Nangis would write. In this city are Greeks, Bulgarians, Alans, Comans, Pigmaticans, Italians, Venetians, Romanians, Dacians, English, Amalfitans, even Turks, many heathen peoples, Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs, and people of all nations come together here. The doors of the houses were often built of iron, studded with stout nails. Large houses had a courtyard with stables, cattle sheds, chicken coops, and storerooms looking out over it. Staircases were built of wood, although stone was used in the more prosperous houses, and in some, even marble. Many of these wealthy houses were also centrally heated, using a hypercaused system inherited directly from the ancient Romans, although most people simply burned charcoal in iron braziers. Their kitchens had low hearths with square pipes forming a chimney to carry away their smoke. During the day, the skyline of Constantinople must have been fogged with the smoke from these chimneys, and the smells of wood smoke and baking food must have drifted out over its terracotta tiles. The tastes of the city would have been distinctive, too. According to the 11th century cook Simeon Seth, cinnamon arrived in the city around this time, which he believed came from the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. In fact, it had likely traveled all the way from Sri Lanka. Byzantines ate fish like the bass and gray mullet, and drank spiced wine called konditon, along with sausages and the ubiquitous fermented fish sauce known as garum, which would have filled the air with its earthy sea salt aroma.
New crops like aubergines or eggplant, along with spinach, oranges, and lemons arrived in Constantinople and all of these would have added to the smells wafting through these streets. Street performers would have plied their trades, acrobats and jugglers and fire eaters. One bishop of Cremona visiting in the year 949 describes seeing one of these performances. A man carried on his head, without using his hands, a wooden pole 24 feet or more long. Then two boys appeared who went up on the pole, did various tricks on it and then came down head first, keeping the pole all the time as steady as though it were rooted in the earth, which filled me with great astonishment and admiration. But of course, being poor in Constantinople was a pretty miserable existence. Only the most fortunate among them lived in houses which were rooved over with rushes and floored with beaten earth. From the 5th century onwards, skyscraper blocks of flats containing anything from five to nine stories were built as tenement buildings, just like in a modern city. These were divided into flats which were let out to working people at exploitative prices and were usually little better than slums. One visitor to the city named Odo of Dioi, passing through in the year 1147, summarizes the seedy underbelly of the city with this stinging observation. Constantinople is a city of extremes. She surpasses other cities in wealth, and she surpasses them in vice. Constantinople itself is squalid and fetid, and in many places afflicted by permanent darkness. For the wealthy overshadow the streets with buildings and leave these dirty, dark places to the poor and to travellers. There, murders and robberies and other crimes of the night are committed. People live untouched by the law in this city, for all its rich men are bullies and many of its poor men are thieves. But whatever the varying feelings about this city, no one could deny that it was a vibrant, energetic place. A later writer, Nicetas Konaites, describes some of the smells of sizzling food that must have filled the streets of Constantinople on a daily basis as the city's different cultures mixed and melded their culinary traditions. They reveled and drank strong wine all day long. Some favored luxury foods while others recreated their own native dishes such as ox rib apiece, slices of salt pork cut with beans, and sauces made with garlic or combination of other bitter flavors. It wasn't just the smell of food that would have filled the air. In fact, Constantinople was famous for its spice markets and perfumeries, as this extract from the City Guild's Book of Regulations shows. They are to sell pepper, spikenard, cinnamon, alloswood, ambergris, musk, frankincense, myrrh, balsam, indigo, dyer's herbs, lapis lazuli, fustic, storex, and in short any article used for perfumery and dyeing. Their stalls shall be placed in a row between the milestone and the revered icon of Christ that stands above the bronze arcade so that the aroma may waft upwards to the icon and at the same time fill the vestibule of the royal palace. Sugar, ginger, and sandalwood came to Byzantium from India, while nutmeg and cloves came from as far away as Indonesia. On the days when imperial processions and religious ceremonies were being held, the unpleasant everyday smells of the medieval city were covered with wreaths of rosemary and pine chips, as well as rose petals which were hung in the streets along with bundles of marjoram. But above everything else, visitors to the city were struck time and again with awe by its size and magnificence. At half a million people, it was the largest city they would ever see. On witnessing its massive walls, its paved boulevards, and tall spiraling columns, its vast palace and the golden dome of the Hagia Sophia,
glinting in the sun, visitors to the city were often left speechless. In the mid-10th century, the poet Constantinus of Rhodes wrote about the effect this city had on arriving travelers. After a long and wearisome journey, the traveler sees from a distance towers rising high into the air, and like strong giants in stride, columns that rise up to the highest point and tall houses and temples whose vast roofs reach to the heights. Who would not become instantly filled with joy? When he reaches the wall and draws near to the gates, who does not greet the city, lower his neck, kneel to the ground, and grasp the famous earth? But over the preceding centuries, the world around Constantinople had changed. In Western Europe, the post-Roman era had given way to the Middle Ages. The Latin-speaking Western Empire had fractured and made way for a patchwork of kingdoms, speaking numerous different languages, but all tied together with their relationship to a church that spoke Latin in its services. These people of Western Europe seemed terribly crude to the sophisticated people of Byzantium. They referred to them sometimes simply as Latins, but more commonly as Franks. The ancient capital of Rome had risen once again, not as an imperial power but as the center of Roman Catholicism and the seat of the pope. The differences in translation between the Greek and Latin religious texts naturally led to disagreements between the branches of Christianity, some of them exceedingly bitter. In the year 1054, an event known as the East-West Schism would tear the Christian world down the middle. All Latin churches in Constantinople were shut down and excommunications were fired like volleys of arrows from one side of Europe to another. This rift between the Latins and the Greeks would only grow wider as time went on. In Western Europe, a feudal system now dictated that high-born people, the lords and ladies of the land, were born into their right to rule. In the West, it was impossible for peasants to rise above the lowly station they were born into. But in Byzantium, there was no legal status given to nobles. There were the powerful and wealthy, of course, and they used every means available to maintain and increase that power. But those great families could fall and others could rise out of nowhere. The founder of one great ruling dynasty, a 9th century king named Basileus I, is one incredible example. He was another peasant who traveled to the city to escape the poverty of his life in the countryside, and he rose through Byzantine society to become the emperor. Over its history, four emperors of Byzantium were also women. The lack of feudal system also made the empire a remarkably modern kind of bureaucracy for its time. Western European kings now ruled over fractious landholding lords and feudal barons, all of whom had to be constantly placated in order to keep the peace and avoid a civil war. These lords would raise their own armies and taxed their own peasants, only coming together under the king's banner in times of war. But the Byzantine Empire collected taxes directly from its provinces, just as the ancient Romans had, and they operated a centralized bureaucracy that paid magistrates and officials, as well as its powerful and centralized military. But despite this, Byzantine emperors sat at the top of an incredibly precarious pyramid. They were often elected into their place and spent their time on the throne under constant threat from those around them, from other courtiers plotting palace coups, and from members of the military who might grow too powerful and attempt to topple them. Powerful Byzantine emperors ruled through a delicate balancing act, keeping the peace with all the competing interests of the empire, and this posed a constant paradox. Emperors needed competent people to operate.
the various important positions in their government, but the most competent people tended to also be the most ambitious and could therefore pose the greatest danger. To deal with these challenges, Byzantine emperors used a number of different tactics. Firstly, in general, they didn't rule through their family. Any brothers or uncles that might pose a challenge were swiftly shipped off to the provinces the moment a new emperor was crowned and were usually given some inconsequential position where they could cause little trouble. It was also imperial policy that no general was allowed to command troops in his home province, a rule designed to prevent any general from building up too large a base of support and challenging the authority of the empire. As we saw in the last episode, this was a policy that the Han Dynasty of China would have done well to adopt. As a further insurance policy, many emperors gave positions of power to those who could not take the throne, often eunuchs or bishops. Later on, these figures would even be given command of the armies of the empire. But the final insurance policy of any emperor was ensuring that he had a solid base of support among the actual people of the empire and its political elites. If people supported their emperor, then it was less likely that a coup could succeed, and so emperors spent much of their time trying to increase this support, especially in the great city of Constantinople. Despite the reputation it has earned in the West, despotic emperors didn't last long in Byzantium. In the centuries following the rise of Islam, the Byzantine Empire became exceptional at projecting what we might call soft power. Having discovered how costly wars could be, it now preferred, where possible, not to fight. The kings of Byzantium were happy to let the majesty of their capital city speak for itself. They allowed foreign princes and kings to compete for the hands of Byzantine princesses and gave them titles of the empire as a form of honor. The Byzantines hosted young princes of foreign powers, educating them in the capital and raising them among the sophisticated aristocracy of the empire. They were also experts at creating vast ceremonies that impressed and overwhelmed the ambassadors of foreign powers. In the year 946, one delegation from Cilicia were greeted in the reception hall of the Imperial Palace, decked out with silk hangings, laurel wreaths, and flowers, and slung with silver chains, the floors all decorated with Persian carpets, and the whole vast room sprinkled with rosewater. The entire court stood there in ceremonial regalia of red, gold, and purple, thousands of people chanting along with the music of organs. Meanwhile, the emperor sat on a throne modeled after the biblical throne of Solomon, surrounded by mechanical moving animals powered by water and clockwork, birds and lions cast in silver that roared and warbled through intricately designed instruments in their throats. This throne could even be mechanically lifted into the air while the ambassadors knelt before it. All of this theater served to impress and terrify those who visited the empire. All of it projected one simple message, you have arrived in the eye of Europe, the new Rome, the center of the world. It worked. After one visit, the ambassadors of one Prince Vladimir of Kiev returned to their king with the following breathless report about their time in the city. We knew not whether we were in heaven or earth, for on earth there is no such splendor or such beauty. We only knew that God dwells there among men and their service is fairer than the ceremonies of other nations. But soft power didn't always suffice, and when it failed, there was always the Byzantine army. The army of Byzantium was a large and powerful force. In the mid-10th century,
It was made up of roughly 140,000 soldiers. This was around 1% of the empire's population and 5% of all adult males. The army was divided into local defense forces known as temata and the professional standing armies known as tagmata, who were mostly stationed in the capital. These different types of army allowed for some flexibility in warfare but they were also used to keep checks on one another. They were often given joint command of a province, meaning that no one general could get any ideas about turning the strength of his men against the empire and making a bid for the throne, a lesson that seems clearly drawn from the constant civil wars that had once plagued the Western Empire. The Byzantines also employed foreign mercenaries, usually small units of specialized soldiers drawn from neighboring lands. But easily, their most powerful military asset was the formidable might of their capital, the untakable city of Constantinople. Over the centuries, they increased the city's siege defenses even further. The Byzantines constructed several hundred enormous underground cisterns to store water, meaning that they would never run out during even the longest sieges. The largest of these, known as the Basilica Cistern, has 366 columns supporting its immense underground vaults. But just as impressive are three great open-air cisterns built near the Theodosian Walls. To give you a sense of their size, one of them today houses a football stadium. The Byzantines also cast an enormous iron chain, its lengths as thick as a man's arm, that could be winched across the whole length of the Golden Horn, barring entry to the port of the city to any would-be attackers. Time and again, the Byzantines would fall back to the defenses of their city, and there, no attacker was able to defeat them. But through the 11th century, a new threat was rising that would prove a challenge too great for the Byzantine Empire to face alone, a threat that would ultimately force them into a difficult and painful compromise and lead, in the coming centuries, to the ruin and waste of their great capital. This was the rise of the Seljuk Turks. From their homeland near the Aral Sea, the Turks had built an empire that now stretched across mainland Persia and across the Middle East, capturing the cultural center of Baghdad and much of Syria and the eastern Mediterranean coast. In the year 1071, the Byzantine Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes considered them enough of a threat to march an army of 40,000 soldiers into Asia to meet them in battle around the area of modern Armenia at a place called Manzikert. Romanos' army consisted of perhaps 10,000 professional Byzantine soldiers with around 30,000 regional mercenaries coming from Georgia, Armenia, and Bulgaria, as well as a large contingent of Turkish mercenaries and even some Norman knights led by a Frankish general. The march across Anatolia was long and difficult, and the Emperor Romanos didn't endear himself to his troops on the journey. He brought along a luxurious baggage train while they suffered in hardship. Whispers soon began to spread around the soldiers and the mood turned mutinous. On the eve of the battle, Romanos split his army in two, intending to send one half in a flanking maneuver against the Turks. But instead, these 20,000 soldiers seemed to have disbanded, leaving him with only half his army left. Some of the Turkish mercenaries seem to have sensed that they were on the losing side, and even defected to the Turkish sultan who welcomed them as brothers. In the ensuing Battle of Manzikert, the Byzantines were utterly smashed and the Emperor Romanos was captured.
captured, the first Roman emperor to be taken prisoner in battle in over 900 years. When he was brought before the presence of the Turkish sultan, the victorious ruler refused to believe that the bloodied and tattered man before him was the mighty emperor of the Romans. But the Turkish sultan was magnanimous in victory. Romanus stayed in the sultan's table while the terms of the empire's surrender were negotiated. The loss at Manzikert was a devastating blow for the Byzantine Empire. While casualties in the battle itself were not enormous, the blow to its morale was devastating. When the emperor Romanus returned to the empire, ransomed at the price of 1.5 million gold pieces, with several cities surrendered to the Turks and his daughter promised in marriage to one of their princes, the humiliation proved too much for his subjects. He was toppled from power and cruelly blinded, later dying from an infection related to his wounds. It's here that the empire's real troubles began. The Byzantine system of succession cobbled together haphazardly and involving much bribery, deceit, and coup plotting had worked mostly fine during times of plenty. But under these times of stress, it fractured. The toppling of this emperor led to a 30-year period of unrest, civil war, and palace coups that did far more to damage the Byzantine state than a thousand battles of Manzikert ever could have. The emperor Romanos had marched to Manzikert with an army of more than 40,000, but less than a decade later, the armies fighting in the civil wars barely topped 4,000. There were now virtually no Byzantine armies defending the east. The Turks advanced with ease and took more Byzantine cities, so that right as the empire's armies were destroying each other, it was also losing the economic base it would have required to rebuild them. In only a few years, the Byzantines lost all of their vast heartlands in Asia and their enemies on all sides were emboldened. The catastrophe was so great that Byzantine historians rarely name the Battle of Manzikert, simply referring to it as that dreadful day. The historian Anna Komnena, writing only a few decades later, wrote the following mournful appraisal of the situation. The fortunes of the Roman Empire had sunk to their lowest ebb, for the armies of the east were dispersed in all directions because the Turks had overspread and gained command of countries between the Black Sea and the Hellespont, and the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean. Another Byzantine historian, Michael Atalaites, was even more full of doom. We were pressed on all sides by the bonds of death. For centuries now, Western Europe had relied on the Byzantines to hold back the armies of the various Muslim empires that had risen and fallen in Asia. But it was becoming increasingly clear that they couldn't hold out on their own forever. If Byzantium was to continue what the West saw as guarding the gates of Europe, it would need a greater level of military support. In fact, it would need a radical solution that would reshape the balance of power in Europe. Into this situation strode a militant and ambitious pope named Urban II and he would usher in a new age of violence and conflict that would seek to restore the power and standing of Byzantium but which would ultimately threaten to tear the entire empire apart. Before becoming pope, Urban II had been a French noble. He had a vision of a new kind of aggressive, expansionist Christianity and soon, one Byzantine emperor would give him the chance to test it out. The emperor Alexios I Komnenos
feared for the future of his empire. His Asian lands had completely fallen into the hands of the Turks, and the Byzantines had neither the resources nor the manpower to do anything about it. By the year 1095, it seemed that even the great capital of Constantinople could be in danger, and so Alexios sent out a dramatic series of requests for help, as one anonymous Byzantine source recalls. Alexios everywhere sent letters, heavy with lamentation and full of weeping, begging with tears for the aid of the entire Christian people, and promising very generous rewards to those who would give help. Alexios even sent requests for help to some of the empire's bitterest rivals, the bishops of the Roman Catholic Church. In response to his letters, Alexios had probably expected the kind of help he'd gotten in the past, perhaps a few regiments of well-equipped western knights to strengthen his beleaguered armies. But he would get much, much more than he bargained for. On the 27th of November 1095, Pope Urban II called together the Council of Clermont and urged all those present to take up arms under the sign of the cross. For centuries now, European pilgrims had traveled to Jerusalem, to the site where that Jewish rebel had been executed by the occupying Roman forces and where the world's largest religion had been born. As we've seen, this pilgrimage route usually took them through Byzantium, crossing the Bosphorus at Constantinople, and passing through the Cilician gates into Syria and down the coast of the Mediterranean. But with Jerusalem in the hands of the Turks, Pope Urban had a vision of what he called an armed pilgrimage that would spread fire and death in its wake. He declared that with the army they raised, they would recover Jerusalem and the east. He promised that all those who went to war on his behalf, from the generals to the lowliest foot soldier, would be forgiven of all their sins. To the sin-obsessed people of medieval Europe, this was an incredible promise and the response they got was enormous. The Byzantine historian Anacomneno, the daughter of the Emperor Alexios, writing in the 12th century, gives one incredible description of the arrival of this great army. Then came an innumerable, heterogeneous crowd collected from nearly all the Frankish countries, together with their leaders, kings, dukes, counts, and even bishops. One might have likened them to the stars of heaven or the sand poured out along the edge of the sea, for these men that hurried on to approach Constantinople were as many as there are leaves and flowers in the springtime. This unruly horde is thought to have contained more than a hundred thousand people, a vast migration of westerners into the east. It was made up largely of mobs of poor peasants gathered from all the towns and villages of western Europe and had marched across the continent, looting and stealing everywhere they passed through. They had only got as far as the Rhineland in Germany when they ran out of provisions, and in response, they lashed out in anger at the sizable Jewish population who lived there, massacring their villages and stealing their food and livestock. The Jewish poet and legal scholar Eliezer ben Nathan, writing around the year 1096, described these crusaders in the following terms. Cruel foreigners, fierce and swift Frenchmen and Germans who put crosses on their clothing and were more plentiful than locusts on the face of the earth. When the emperor Alexios saw this vast horde gathered outside the walls of Constantinople, his blood must have run cold. One particularly unruly group of crusaders, led by a man named Peter the Hermit, even began looting the countryside and burning Byzantine villages near the capital. The emperor had to dispatch troops to return order. He must have wondered whether unleashing the
this fearsome force was worth the risk. But perhaps against his better judgment, he decided to make his deal with the devil. After all, these were Christians, even if they were the rough and unsophisticated sort of Latin Christian commonly found in the west. If this unruly army was what it would take to protect his empire, then he would have to accept it. So, he allowed this vast crusader army to cross the Bosphorus and helped them with organization and supplies while they passed into Anatolia, through the gates of Cilicia, and into the Holy Land. The crusaders, despite their general lack of experience and equipment, did very well. Their vast army took the city of Nicaea in 1097 and Antioch a year after that. Jerusalem was reached in June of 1099 and taken by an assault one month later with the crusaders massacring the defenders. For the next 200 years, there would be some form of crusader presence in the eastern Mediterranean. They set up small city-states and crusader kingdoms, a kind of early prototype of the settler states that would later characterize European colonialism. For a period of about two centuries, the gamble that the Emperor Alexios had made paid off. The five emperors of his Komnenos dynasty presided over a sustained restoration of the military, economic, and political position of the Byzantine Empire, while their Muslim rivals were busy fighting the constant influx of Latin armies over the cities of the Mediterranean coast. Under this military cover, the Byzantine Empire was able to flourish again. But the empire was living on borrowed time. The power of the crusades demonstrated to the Byzantines that Western Europe was no longer a distant backwater. The scattered remnants of the Western Empire, it had become a world of its own, with its own tensions, its own conflicts, and its own interests. The deal that Alexios had made had unleashed dark forces that would ultimately spiral out of control and bring the whole empire of Byzantium to the brink of destruction. This would all finally come to a head during perhaps the most disgraceful campaign conducted by a crusading army in the east, and it would be known to history as the Fourth Crusade. The goal of the Fourth Crusade was much like those that had come before it, to recapture the city of Jerusalem which was then held by the powerful Ayyubid Sultanate. Crusades had always been chaotic, poorly organized affairs, run as a kind of directed anarchy. But the Fourth Crusade set a new standard for chaos. Almost immediately, they ran into problems. The crusaders had planned to march to Venice and their by-passage on Venetian ships to the Holy Land. But when they arrived in Venice, they found that they didn't have enough money to pay their transport. The Venetians saw an opportunity. They asked the crusaders to march to the town of Zara, one of their rival cities in modern Croatia that was then held by the Christian Kingdom of Hungary and burned it to the ground. The crusaders debated for a long time but ultimately decided that any action was justified if it ultimately ended up in the recapture of Jerusalem. They marched to Zara, besieged the city, sacked it, and burned it to the ground. This act of violence against their fellow Christians shocked all of Europe. Pope Innocent III issued an order of excommunication for the whole crusader army, writing the following burning condemnation of their actions. Behold, your gold has turned into base metal, and your silver has almost completely rusted. Since departing from the purity of your plan and turning aside from the path onto the impassable road, you have withdrawn your hand from the plow. For when you should have hastened to the land flowing with milk and honey, you turned
away, going astray in the direction of the desert. The leaders of the Crusader army, perhaps wisely, chose not to pass news of their excommunication down to their men. But while many viewed the presence of this vast unruly army as a danger, others saw in it an opportunity. One of these men was named Alexios IV Angelos. Alexios had been the son of a Byzantine emperor but his father had been deposed in a coup, and now he lived in exile with his brother-in-law, the king of Germany. Angelos lived much of his early life in a state of great bitterness about his family's loss, and he must have spent long hours fantasizing about returning himself to the throne of Byzantium. All his life, he had been told that the people of Constantinople waited in anxious anticipation of his return, and perhaps he even believed it. When he heard news of the failing fourth crusade, still heavily in debt to the Venetians, running out of money and wintering in the ruined city of Zara, he saw his chance. Angelos approached the leaders of the crusade and offered them a simple deal. You take the city of Constantinople and put me on its throne, and I will open the vast treasuries of Byzantium, pay off your debts, and fund the rest of your crusade to Jerusalem. The leaders of the crusade jumped at the opportunity. When Pope Innocent heard of their plans, he wrote to them again, pleading with them to stop the violence against their fellow Christians. But it was too late. The crusaders set sail in April 1203 aboard a Venetian fleet, including a hundred ships designed for horse transport. But even on their journey to the city, they began to detect warning signs that the Emperor Angelos may not have the army of loyal subjects inside Constantinople that he had boasted about, as one crusader leader, Count Hugh of St Paul, recalls. We passed by the arm of St George and made port on solid ground in the direction of Iconium. This port lies one league from Constantinople. There we were stunned, very much astonished, that none of the friends or family of the young man who was with us or any messenger of theirs came to him, who might tell him about the situation in the city. When the fourth crusade arrived at Constantinople on the 23rd of June 1203, the city had a population of approximately 500,000 people. One French historian and knight among them, named Geoffrey of Villardouin, wrote one account that records how the crusaders felt when they finally set their eyes on the great city of Constantine. All those who had never seen Constantinople before gazed very intently upon the city, having never imagined there could be so fine a place in the entire world. They noted the high walls and lofty towers encircling it, its rich palaces and tall churches, of which there were so many that no one would have believed it to be true had he not seen it with his own eyes, and viewed the length and breadth of that city which reigns supreme over all others. There was indeed no man so brave and daring that his flesh did not shudder at the sight. The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the state's army, and the city was now defended by a garrison of only 15,000 men, including 5,000 of the famed Varangian Guard, those Viking warriors who defended the kings of Byzantium. The crusaders crossed the Bosphorus in their fleet of more than 200 ships, and saw that the great defensive chain had been drawn across the Golden Horn, as Sir Hugh recalls. Then we made our way towards a certain heavily fortified tower known as Galata. A very great, excessively thick iron chain was fastened to it. It ran across the sea, stretching from the tower all the way to the city walls.
After a number of unsuccessful assaults with the crusaders taking heavy losses, on the 12th of April, they were finally successful. They landed their ships below the sea walls of Constantinople, much lower than the land walls in the West. They anchored their ships below the walls and swarmed up their masts, scrambling across catwalks to reach the ramparts. Other ships landed on the shoreline and used picks and shovels to hack away at a gateway that the defenders had hurriedly bricked up. The city's defenders were beaten back and the crusaders managed to break the chain that hung over the Golden Horn. They sailed into the port of Constantinople and raised up their exile prince, Alexios Angelos. He had told them that the people of Constantinople would welcome him with open arms, cheering him as a liberator. But the sounds they heard in that moment were not cheers. In fact, half the population of Constantinople had come out to jeer at the emperor in exile from the walls. But the numbers of the crusader army won out and the emperor of the time soon fled the city. The exile Alexios Angelos was crowned Emperor of the Romans on the 1st of August. But now, Angelos realized that his grand promises about paying off the crusaders' debts would have to be kept. The crusader Sir Hugh, writing to the Pope and trying his best to make the conquest of Constantinople look like it had been a good idea, reassured him of Angelos' promises. Our new emperor, with everything that he had promised us fully and completely rendered, bound himself to us by oath to cross the sea with us in next March's voyage, accompanied by 10,000 soldiers, and to provide food for one year to the entire army of the Lord. But the actual situation was much different. Angelos soon found that he had vastly overestimated the wealth he would find in the imperial treasury. A century of civil wars had all but emptied it. When the previous emperor fled the city, he had taken with him more than a thousand pounds of gold, along with priceless jewels. With the large and unruly crusader army still camped, restless, and impatient in the city, awaiting their payment, the new emperor Angelos ordered that the funds should be raised by any means necessary. He ordered soldiers to march through the streets, bursting into churches, and taking any priceless works of Byzantine art that they could find. These were to be destroyed and melted down to strip them of their gold. The sight of this new emperor sending troops into the churches to destroy their treasures must have sent shivers down the spines of the average citizen of Constantinople. But even then, Angelos had barely made a dent in the sum he had promised to the Latin warriors. Frustrated at their inability to fight with Muslims in the Holy Land, the crusaders began destroying Constantinople's mosques and persecuting its small Muslim community. But Constantinople lived up to its reputation as the refuge of strangers. The city's residents came out in force to protect their Muslim community from the foreign soldiers, and in retaliation, the crusaders set the city ablaze. Riots soon broke out in the city. These riots turned into a full-blown revolution, and the new emperor Angelos was swiftly overthrown by a rebel leader named Ducas. He was strangled in February of the year 1204. The crusaders demanded that the new emperor Ducas honor the debt that had been promised to them. When he refused, they embarked on a campaign of revenge and destruction that saw the city ravaged over three days of blood and fire. The historian Niketas Koniates, who lived in Constantinople at the time, records what happened next. Constantine's fair city, a common delight and boast of all nations, was laid waste with fire and blackened by soot, taken and emptied of all wealth.
The crusaders began an unconstrained campaign of looting and destruction, aimed at stripping every ounce of value from this great city. Niketas Koniates mourns the events of those days. Bloody raindrops did not pour down from the heaven, nor did the harvest turn blood red, nor did fiery stones fall out of the sky, nor was anything new observed. But many-legged and many-handed justice appeared without the sound of footfall or hand clap, as a zealous avenger fell silently and inaudibly upon the city and made us the most ill-starred of men. During those three days, many works of priceless Roman and Greek art were either stolen or destroyed. The famous bronze horses that decorated the Hippodrome were sent back to adorn the facade of Saint Mark's Basilica in Venice, where they remain to this day. Other statues were melted down to make bronze coins, as Niketas Koniates recalls. These barbarians, haters of the beautiful, did not allow the statues standing in the Hippodrome and other marvelous works of art to escape destruction, but all were made into coins. Thus, great things were exchanged for small ones. The crusaders systematically violated the city's holy sanctuaries, destroying or stealing all they could lay hands on. Not even the tombs of the emperors inside the Saint Apostle's Church were spared. Thousands of Constantinople's civilian population were massacred and most of the Byzantine aristocracy fled the city. Niketas Koniates describes a column of aristocratic refugees fleeing the city and being mocked for their ill fortunes by Byzantine commoners. The peasants and common riffraff jeered at those of us from Byzantium and were sick-headed enough to call our miserable poverty and nakedness a quality. Many were only too happy to accept this outrage, saying, blessed be the Lord that we have grown rich, and buying up for next to nothing the property that their fellow countrymen were forced to offer for sale, for they had not yet much to do with the beef-eating Latins, and they did not know that they served up bile-like wine, nor that they would treat the Byzantines with utter contempt. Declaring a great victory for Christendom, the crusaders selected an emperor from among their ranks and divided the territory of the empire into various new crusader states. The Byzantine Empire fractured. Constantinople was ruled by a western emperor for the next 60 years and its citizens referred to this regime as Francocratia, or the rule of the Franks. But the Latins soon found that governing this large and fractious empire was no easy matter. Over the course of their rule, they lost one territory after another until their empire was reduced to no more than the city of Constantinople, while a number of competing states at Nicaea and Trebizond claimed the true mantle of Byzantium. The last Latin emperor of Constantinople was a man nicknamed Baldwin the Broke due to his incessant money problems. He was forced to sell some of the city's priceless Christian relics to keep the state running. He sent the supposed crown of Jesus to the west in exchange for much needed cash, and even sent one of his sons to Venice as collateral for a loan. Baldwin's mismanagement proved too much for the people of the empire and he was eventually ousted from the throne by a Byzantine lord. The throne of Constantinople returned to the hands of the Byzantines. Much of modern Greece and the Asian territories returned to the empire, but it was still a much diminished throne. A monk named Photi travelled through the Byzantine countryside to Constantinople only a few years later, in the year 1277, and commented on the diminished state of the once great empire. Although the cathedrals are magnificent, we were greatly saddened to see the rest of the city had fallen on hard times.
trade has been severely curtailed. The outrage, the new trading colonies of the wicked Latins, they have insinuated themselves to secure advantages at the expense of the Greeks. The spacious markets were mostly abandoned. Many of its fine stone churches were in a poor state of repair. Over the decades since the sack of the city and the mismanagement of the Latin emperors, the population of Constantinople had barely recovered. It was no more than 35,000 by the end of the reign of Baldwin the Broke, and the city during this time must have been an eerie place. The streets of the capital no longer bubbled with the sounds of a dozen languages and merchant ships no longer stopped at its harbour. Constantinople was now little more than a cluster of villages inside the ancient walls, separated by overgrown wasteland, fields, and crumbling ruins, as the Burgundian noble Bertrandin de la Broquière recalled in 1432 with something of a sneer. The city of Constantinople is made up of villages. There is much more open space than buildings. Another visitor during this time, an archbishop of Smyrna named Brocardus, wrote with barely concealed disappointment about the city he found within the great Theodosian walls. Although the city is large, only a modest number of people live there in relation to its size. Barely a third of the city is inhabited. The rest is made up of gardens, or fields, or vineyards, or wasteland. The population consists of fishermen, merchants, artisans, and cultivators. The nobles are few in number. They're as weak as women. If we want to imagine what the city might have looked like during this time, we can look at the example of the war-torn city of Nicosia in Cyprus, where a depopulated buffer zone has existed since 1974, dividing it between north and south. No one lives in this abandoned district of the city, and everywhere nature has taken its course. The roof beams of the abandoned buildings have fallen in, their shattered terracotta tiles littering the ground. Alloes, prickly pears, and olive trees burst through the windows and walls, pushing their roots where the plaster is cracked and broken. Churches and schools, houses, and shops are all crumbling, their rooms now open to the sky, turning into shaded gardens of wild, rambling overgrowth. Now, lapwings and larks flit between the crumbling walls, while endangered species of flower like orchids and the rare cypress tulip grow here among the ruins. Even in the still-populated parts of the city, Constantinople must have been an eerie place. It was built to house more than 500,000 people, but it now contained barely 10% of that number. Its wide avenues and vast spice markets, its fairs and perfumeries, must have been virtually empty, silent and cold as packs of dogs wandered through the lonely streets. The Byzantine Empire was now a shadow of its former self. The 14th century brought crop failures and the Great Famine of 1315, but this was followed quickly by the arrival of an even greater disaster, one that would spread death and destruction to every corner of Europe. That was the arrival of the Black Death. The first records of the plague begin in the city of Kaffa in Crimea. The city was under siege by forces of the Mongol Empire, but then what seemed like a miracle happened. A disease began to spread among the Mongol troops, one so devastating that it forced them to abandon their siege. But as a parting shot, the Mongol commander loaded the bodies of some of the plague victims onto his catapults and hurled them into the town.
As soon as the Mongols left, a group of and brought the plague with them. Constantinople was the epicenter for the Black Death in Europe. It spread from there along all of Europe's trade routes and caused tremendous mortality along the way. The Black Death would visit Constantinople 11 times over the next hundred years, and each wave of the disease had devastating consequences. The Greek writer Nikephoros Gregoras wrote about the horrifying effects of this disease on the city. During that time, a serious and pestilential disease invaded humanity. Starting from Scythia and Maotis, it lasted for that whole year, passing through and destroying the continental coast, towns as well as country areas, up to Gedera and the columns of Hercules. The prominent signs of this disease were tumorous outgrowths at the roots of thighs and arms, and simultaneously bleeding ulcerations which carried the infected rapidly out of this life. One Byzantine emperor, Ioannis VI, even had his youngest son killed by the plague. Later in his life, he retired to a monastery after losing a disastrous six-year civil war and devoted his time to writing a recent history of the Byzantine Empire. In it, he described the destruction wrought on his people by the disease. The invading plague started from the Scythians, attacked almost all the sea coasts of the world, and killed most of their people. For it swept not only through Pontus, Thrace, and Macedonia, but even Greece, Italy, and all the islands, Egypt, Libya, Judea, and Syria, and spread throughout almost the entire world. So incurable was the evil that neither any regularity of life nor any bodily strength could resist it. Strong and weak bodies were all carried away, and those best cared for died in the same manner as the poor. In the 14th century, the Byzantine Empire had begun to look remarkably like the Western Roman Empire nearly a thousand years before. The plague exacerbated its economic problems, and a number of destructive civil wars had fatally drained the empire's manpower and resources. In the year 1343, the Empress Dowager, known as Anna of Savoy, embroiled in a raging civil war over the Byzantine throne, even took the drastic measure of pawning the empire's crown jewels to the Venetians, which included the imperial crown. While this was nominally a loan, Venice paid 30,000 ducats for these jewels, which included the imperial crown. This was more than twice what the city of Constantinople produced in a year, and the Byzantines had no hope of ever repaying it. Although subsequent Byzantine rulers tried to get these jewels back, they met with no success, and the empire's crown jewels would remain in Venice until the city's capture by Napoleon, when they were likely melted down for their gold. In place of the old Byzantine crown, the rulers of the empire now sat under a shoddy new crown made of gilded leather and cut glass. This was a sad symbol of the reduced state of Byzantium. But luckily, the empire's rivals were also suffering. While it mostly avoided the ravages of the plague, the empire of the Seljuk Turks was destroyed by the arrival of the Mongol armies of Genghis Khan. Baghdad was burned in the year 1258, and the River Tigris famously ran red with blood and black with the ink of the books thrown into the waters from Baghdad's libraries. The Seljuk territories were divided into a number of small Mongol client states known as beyliks. But once the Mongol armies left, one of these states would soon rise to conquer the others and reform the power that the Seljuks had once held. This was a state known as the Ottoman, and its rise would spell the final end for Byzantium.
The Ottoman rise to power in Anatolia is wreathed in legend and it can be difficult to separate fact from fiction. But it's clear that they had great diplomatic skill and the ability to raise vast numbers of troops, especially powerful units of archers. Within 90 years of the first establishment of the Ottoman Beylik, they had grown into a powerful force and the Byzantine Empire had once again lost every one of its Asian territories to its expansion. In the year 1354, a great earthquake struck the region and the Byzantine fortress in Gallipoli in Europe was all but destroyed. The Greek citizens of the area fled the destruction and the Ottoman Sultan seized his chance. He crossed the waters into Europe and occupied the area, quickly fortifying it and refusing to leave, despite the pleas of the Byzantine Emperor. This was the first foothold in Europe for the new power of the Ottoman Empire and their presence here would only grow as the 14th and 15th centuries wore on. By 1400, the Roman Empire had been reduced to nothing more than the city of Constantinople, some territories in Greece, and a few Aegean islands. The Ottoman Empire advanced in Europe, swallowing up territories, and slowly a pincer began to form around the city of Constantinople. The powers of the west, realizing too late the danger posed by the Ottomans, put together a number of crusades in an attempt to halt their conquests. But for Byzantium, their help with a price. In the Council of Florence, which opened in the year 1438, the Byzantines met with delegates from the Latin Church in an attempt to bring the two sides of the Christian world together. But what took place was less a compromise than a complete surrender. The Greek Orthodox priests caved in to Latin pressure on a number of key theological differences and essentially surrendered to the authority of the Pope. The reaction in Byzantium was bitter. Many saw this surrender as a necessary evil, a temporary measure while the threat of the Ottoman advance loomed over the city's head. But others saw in it a kind of cultural suicide. One Byzantine priest, Lucas Notaris, is even said to have uttered this damning indictment. I would rather see a Turkish turban in the midst of the city than a Latin mitre. To many, it must have seemed that Byzantium had pawned away not just its princes, its holy relics, and its crown jewels, but also its very soul. To add insult to injury, this spiritual compromise achieved very little. The Crusade of Nicopolis that the Latin Church put together in the year 1396 was utterly defeated by Ottoman forces. Half a century later, the Crusade of Varna met with an even more crushing defeat, with the king of Poland, King Wladyslaw III, dying in battle. These efforts distracted the Ottomans for some time but their abject failures discouraged the kings of the West from sending any more aid to the dying empire of Byzantium. The man who would finally topple the empire that had lasted for a thousand years was born in the year 1432. He was an Ottoman king by the name of Mehmed II and he would be known to history as Mehmed the Conqueror. The Sultan Mehmed was an enigmatic character, full of contradictions. He came to the throne of the Ottoman Empire in the year 1444, a boy of only 11 years old. His mother had been a slave and when he was crowned, he swore by the Prophet and the Quran that he would devote himself to maintain
gaining peace with the empire of In Constantinople, church bells rang out in celebration at the news of his coronation. But Mehmed had many sides to his character. On one hand, he was a poet and a scholar, fluent in several languages, but he also had a cold and ruthless side. Upon becoming sultan, still only a boy, it's said that he strangled his infant half-brother in his crib to remove the potential challenger to his throne. The young Mehmed inherited an empire that was already of considerable size. It held territory across much of what is today Turkey, as well as large holdings in Greece and Bulgaria. But there was still one territory in the midst of all this land that he still couldn't lay claim to. That was the city of Constantinople. At the age of 21, in the year 1453, the young Mehmed decided to take his chances. But the city was still a formidable target. It was guarded by only about 10,000 soldiers. But its triple line of land walls, built nearly a thousand years before, had never been breached. Mehmed knew that to bring down those walls, his armies would need a weapon of a size and power that the world had never seen. To help him in this task, he hired the services of a radical Hungarian engineer named Orban. Orban had actually offered his services to the Byzantines first, but the cash-strapped empire had refused to give him any money, perhaps not believing his fantastical promises. So he went instead to the capital of the Ottoman Empire and approached the Sultan Mehmed himself. Give me the bronze and the gold, he told the sultan, and I will build you a cannon such as the world has never seen. Mehmed asked Orban if he could build a cannon that would bring down the Theodosian walls of Constantinople, and Orban gave this reply. I can cast a cannon of bronze with the capacity of the stone you want. I have examined the walls of the city in great detail. I can shatter to dust not only these walls with the stones from my gun, but the very walls of Babylon itself. The young sultan was impressed and he gave Orban everything he asked for. Three months later, the monster cannon was completed and Orban gave it its name, Basilica. Basilica was one of the largest guns ever built. It was over 10 meters long and weighed so much that it had to be dragged to the walls of Constantinople by a team of 60 oxen and 400 men, leveling the land ahead of it and building bridges over ditches and rivers. The cannon edged towards the city at a rate of only four kilometers a day. Slowly but surely, inch by inch, the death of Constantinople was nearing. One of the most remarkable documents to survive from this time is the journal of a Venetian surgeon named Niccolo Barbaro who lived in Constantinople. It gives us an incredibly vivid account of the events of the days that followed. In this journal, Barbaro writes about the day that the full might of the Ottoman army appeared outside the walls of Constantinople. On the fifth month of April, one hour after daybreak, Mahomet Bey came before Constantinople with about 160,000 men and encamped about two and a half miles from the walls of the city. When the sultan arrived at the city with his army and his enormous cannons, he began the siege with a fearsome bombardment. The great cannon basilica was horrifically inaccurate but when it landed a hit, the destruction it caused was immense. Iron cannonballs had yet to be developed and so this cannon hurled smooth balls of marble or granite.
each weighing three-quarters of a ton, walls of Constantinople. Due to the immense amount of explosives used in each firing, the cannon had to be cooled with olive oil between shots. We can imagine the sweating workmen toiling around this bronze monster, the air wavering above its superheated sides, the smell of sizzling oil spattering from it, and the sharp smell of gunpowder in the air as each enormous plume of smoke burst from its gaping mouth, and the sound of its firing echoed off the walls of the city like a thunderclap. Inside the city, the psychological toll of this gun must have been immense. It could only be fired three times a day since it had to be cooled between each shot to prevent the barrel from cracking. But when the thunder of its explosions sounded, the citizens of Constantinople have ducked down and looked up to their ancient walls in fear to see if they would hold. The Venetian Niccolo Barbaro remembers the frantic attempts to repair the walls as the bombardment rained down on the city. The Venetians set about making good and strong repairs where they were needed at the broken walls. These repairs were made with barrels filled with stones and earth, and behind them there was made a very wide ditch with a dam at the end of it which was covered with strips of vine and other layers of branches drenched with water to make them solid so that it was as strong as the wall had been. The bombardment of the city went on for 48 days with repeated attempts by the Turks to storm the walls. But even under the fearsome cannon fire and vastly outnumbered, the walls of Constantinople held. Barbaro's diary recounts the fierce fighting that took place. They found the Turks coming right up under the walls and seeking battle, particularly the Janissaries. When one or two of them were killed, at once more Turks came and took away the dead ones, without caring how near they came to the city walls. Our men shot at them with guns and crossbows aiming at the Turk who was carrying away his dead countrymen, and both of them would fall to the ground dead. And then there came other Turks and took them away, none fearing death, but being willing to let ten of themselves be killed rather than suffer the shame of leaving a single Turkish corpse by the walls. In their moment of darkness, the Byzantines looked to their ancient heritage. The Emperor Constantine XI is said to have addressed his soldiers defending the walls with the following cry. Hurl your javelins and arrows against them so that they know that they are fighting with the descendants of the Greeks and the Romans. The siege of Constantinople is one of those historical events that has been told and retold countless times, and its events have passed into legend. The fighting on the water, the defenders waiting for the Venetian reinforcements that never came, the Turkish sappers digging tunnels under the walls, and the Byzantines discovering them, the Sultan Mehmed's daring surprise plan to carry his boats over the land, rolling them on wooden rollers and into the waters of the Golden Horn past its long chain. The events of the siege read like a Hollywood movie, but I think this story has been told enough times by other people. I want to focus here on what it must have felt like to be a normal person living in the city of Constantinople during this siege, how it must have felt to watch this city finally come apart from the inside. During the siege, prayers were held daily in the Hagia Sophia, the austere, somber chanting of the Byzantine monks soaring out over the imprisoned people of the city. The rolling thunder of cannon fire would have sounded outside the walls like a storm, the firecracker sounds of the smaller guns popping in the distance, and the booming thunder of the larger bombards. When the wind blew towards the city, there must have been a constant smell of gunpowder in the streets from the Turkish capital.
cannons camped far outside the walls. Barbaro notes the growing shortages in the city. The city was in great distress because of a growing lack of provisions, particularly of bread, wine, and other things necessary to sustain life. As the mood inside the city darkened and panic began to set in, Barbaro remembers the appearance of ominous signs in the sky overhead. On this same day, the 22nd of May, there appeared a sign in the sky which was to tell Constantine, the worthy emperor of Constantinople, that his proud empire was about to come to an end. At the first hour after sunset the moon rose. It rose as if it were no more than a three-day moon, with only a little of it showing, although the air was clear and unclouded, pure as crystal. The moon stayed in this form for about four hours and gradually increased to a full circle so that at the sixth hour of the night it was fully formed. When we Christians and the pagans had seen this marvellous sign, the emperor of Constantinople was greatly afraid, and so were all his nobles, because the Greeks had a prophecy which said that Constantinople would never fall until the full moon should give a sign. And panic wasn't confined to the common people of the city. Barbaro notes the increasing despair of the Byzantine emperor and his grief at being left to fight alone by his western allies. At this point, the most serene emperor began to weep bitterly for grief, because the Venetians had not sent help, and when the emperor saw this, he decided to put himself in the hands of our most merciful Lord Jesus Christ and of his mother, Madonna Saint Mary, and of Saint Constantine, defender of his city, for them to guard it. As the walls were pounded into rubble by the enormous Turkish guns, panic began to spread among the commanders of the army too, a panic that became contagious and spread through all the city's people. Zuan Zustignan, that Genoese of Genoa, decided to abandon his post and fled to his ship which was lying at the boom. The emperor had made this Zuan Zustignan captain of his forces and as he fled, he went through the city crying, the Turks have got into the city. As despair set in in the streets of Constantinople, it was matched by signs of celebration that could be seen in the Turkish camp outside the walls, whose lights were visible at night to the sentries on the walls. The Turks set fires blazing brightly through the whole of their camp. Every tent in their camp lit two fires of great size and the light from them was so strong that it seemed as if it were day. These fires burned until midnight and the sultan had them lit in his camp to encourage his men because the time was coming for the destruction of the city. And finally, the time had come. The final assault on the city began and the Turkish soldiers burst over the walls. Barbaro recalls the sound and fury of the ensuing battle. At sunrise, the Turks entered the city near San Romano, where the walls had been razed to the ground by their cannon. After being driven back from the barbicans, the Turks again fired their great cannon and the pagans like hounds came on behind the smoke of the cannon, raging and pressing on each other like wild beasts, so that in the space of a quarter of an hour, there were more than 30,000 Turks inside the barbicans, with such cries that it seemed a very inferno and the shouting was heard as far away as Anatolia. Just like the soldiers of the fourth crusade two and a half centuries before, the Ottomans rampaged through the city and the bloodshed was tremendous. Around the city, the flags of Byzantium, those crescent moon and stars, were torn down and Ottoman flags were flown in their place. Hopelessness began to set in.
sin among the citizens. All through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city. The blood flowed in the city like rainwater in the gutters after a sudden storm, and the corpses of Turks and Christians were thrown into the Dardanelles, where they floated out to sea like melons along a canal. No one could hear any news of the emperor, what he had been doing or whether he was dead or alive, but some said that his body had been seen among the corpses, and it was said that he had hanged himself at the moment when the Turks broke in at the San Romano gate. Finally the city was taken, and the Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror strode into the ruined streets victorious. It's said that when he stepped into the haunting ruins of the ancient palace of Bucolean, probably built by the emperor Theodosius in the 5th century, a thousand years before, Mehmed uttered two haunting lines by the famous Persian poet Firdusi, which encapsulate the melancholy ruin that must have spread before his eyes. The spider weaves the curtains in the palace of the Caesars. The owl calls the watches in the towers of Afrasyab. The Byzantine Empire had lasted for 1,123 years and 18 days. But now the great liturgy that echoed from the dome of the Hagia Sophia fell silent. After the fall of Constantinople, a number of Byzantine lords held on to the fragments of the empire for a few more years. But by 1461, they had all surrendered. Mehmed the Conqueror moved the capital of his empire to Constantinople and gave himself the title of Caesar. He also set about an ambitious project to restore the capital of Constantine, just as the ancient emperor had more than a millennia before. At the palace of Blakone, now crumbling and in ruins, he began a series of renovations, laying out magnificent gardens that the historian Cretobulus of Imbros recalls with awe. Around the palace, he laid out a circle of large and beautiful gardens, burgeoning with various fine plants, bringing forth fruits in season, flowing with abundant streams, cold, clear, and good to drink, studded with beautiful groves and meadows, resounding and chattering with flocks of singing birds. For the city's beleaguered inhabitants, the conquest of the city would be a trauma that they could never successfully heal from. The painful truth of their history was converted into legend, just as an oyster converts painful grains of sand into pearls. One such legend is of the priests who had been chanting in the Hagia Sophia when the city fell and who were killed by the rampaging soldiers. They had not been massacred, the legend says, and in fact, had melted by some miracle into the south wall of the sanctuary. One day when the city was back in Christian hands, they would return and take up their service at the point they had been interrupted. Another legend says that the last emperor of Byzantium hadn't perished in the battle for the city. In fact, he had been rescued by an angel and turned to stone. Somewhere in a cave below the Golden Horn, the marble emperor awaits to one day return in triumph. Meanwhile, the Turkish people settled in Byzantium and a great cultural shift took place in the city's population. But the imprint of Byzantium would leave just as indelible a mark on its conquerors as its conquerors left on it. Mehmed II actually claimed that the Ottoman Empire was a continuation of the Roman Empire, not an end to it. In his court, he gathered Italian artists, humanists, and Greek scholars and allowed the Byzantine church to continue functioning in the city. He collected in his palace a library which included works in Persian, Greek, and Latin, and even
invited a Venetian painter to come and its successors abandoned much of these efforts and any claim to the legacy of Rome, it's clear that at least for this emperor of the Ottomans Byzantium had left a deep impression on his soul. And the legacy of Byzantium left its mark too on the religion of Islam. While Mecca and Medina were its spiritual heart, Constantinople became its cultural heart. The crescent moon had been the symbol of Byzantium since as early as 670 BC in honor of the city's patron goddess Artemis. After the capture of Constantinople, Mehmed adopted it for his own banner. Over the centuries that followed, this crescent moon would become official standard of the Ottoman Empire and by the mid-20th century had become recognized as the symbol of Islam. As Constantinople fell, the city that had once accepted refugees from all corners of the world now sent its own people streaming across Europe. Wherever they went, Byzantine refugees brought with them the ancient learnings of the Greeks. While Aristotle had been known in Western Europe for centuries, now the Latins who welcomed the fleeing Byzantines were introduced to the writings of Demosthenes and Xenophon, Plato, Aeschylus, and the Iliad. The historian Edward Gibbon summarizes the seismic effect this had on the learning of Europeans. The restoration of the Greek letters in Italy was prosecuted by a series of emigrants who were destitute of fortune and endowed with learning. From the terror or oppression of the Turkish arms, the natives of Thessalonica and Constantinople escaped to a land of freedom, curiosity, and wealth and taught their native language in the schools of Florence and Rome. Those fleeing Byzantium would tutor scholars like the humanist philosopher Marsilio Ficino and the Italian poet Poliziano in Florence. The wealthy Medici family of Italy became patrons of one Byzantine lecturer, opening up the Platonic Academy of Florence. In this way, the fall of Byzantium laid the seeds of what would become the European Renaissance and as one age of history ended, another would begin. The fall of Byzantium disrupted long-established trade routes that joined Europe to Asia along the Silk Road. This seismic shift forced European traders to find new routes across the continent to the markets of India and China and the developing technology of sailing ships like the caravel became increasingly crucial. Only 35 years after the fall of Constantinople, in the year 1488, the Portuguese explorer Bartholomew Diaz rounded the southernmost Cape of Africa and opened up the sea route to India. Only four years after that, the explorer Christopher Columbus would land in the Bahamas and open up the exploration of the New World. Columbus was inspired to undertake his voyage, in part because of the ancient text known as the Geographia, written by the ancient Greek philosopher Claudius Ptolemy. This text was one of those that was preserved in the libraries of Byzantium and which was brought to Western Europe after its fall. Although governed by different rulers under a different religion, Byzantium would continue to welcome the tired and huddled masses of the world to shelter behind its great walls. In the year 1492, the same year that Columbus discovered Hispaniola, the European antisemitism that had been unleashed by the first crusade reached a fever pitch. All the Jews of Spain were expelled by the Royal Alhambra Decree and the Sultan Bayezid II, the oldest son of Mehmed the Conqueror, himself now a man of 45 years old, dispatched the Ottoman navy to escort the Jews of Spain safely back to settle in his lands. For another generation at least, the city of Constantinople would once again earn the title that once was the capital of Constantinople.
emblazoned its name in the European Queen of the Queens of Cities. Today, as unchanging and static, a relic of the past, they believed that the Byzantine Empire had played little part in the history of Europe except as an embarrassing fossil, a relic of a bygone age. The Turkish author Orhan Pamuk, in his book Istanbul, writes about how the memory of Byzantium has been lost. Like most Istanbul Turks, I had little interest in Byzantium as a child. I associated the word with spooky, bearded, black-robed Greek Orthodox priests, with the aqueducts that still ran through the city, with Hagia Sophia, and the red brick walls of old churches. To me, these were remnants of an age so distant that there was little need to know about it. As for the Byzantines, they had vanished into thin air, or so I'd been led to believe. No one told me that it was their grandchildren's grandchildren's grandchildren who now ran the shoe stores and haberdashery shops of Beoglu. Like Gautier, Pamuk writes movingly about the city of his childhood, a place where the crumbling ruins of the past rose out of the modern streets and the faded districts of Ottoman wood-paneled houses, all of it full of a strange and melancholy beauty. In Istanbul's poor neighborhoods, beauty resides entirely in the crumbling walls, in the grass, ivy, weeds, and trees I remember growing from the towers and walls of the castles. The beauty of a broken fountain, an old ramshackle mansion, the crumbling wall of an old mosque, the vines and plane trees intertwining to shade the old blackened walls of a wooden house. These sad, now vanished ruins gave Istanbul its soul. But to discover the city's soul and its ruins, to see these ruins as expressive of the city's essence, you must travel down a long, labyrinthine path strewn with historical accidents. Pamuk talks about the city's power to be seen through European and Turkish eyes, about how the city of strangers had now become a stranger to its own citizens. A crumbling wall, a wooden teke, condemned, abandoned, and now fallen into neglect. A fountain from whose spouts no water pours, a workshop in which nothing has been produced for 80 years, a collapsing building, a row of houses with crooked window casings. None of these things look beautiful to the people who live amongst them. To savor Istanbul's back streets, to appreciate the vines and trees that endow its ruins with accidental grace, you must, first and foremost, be a stranger to them. Today, the lonely ruins of the Theodosian walls of Constantinople still line the modern city of Istanbul, tracing their battered and crumbling route from the Sea of Marmara to the waters of the Golden Horn. They stand as a testament to the spirit of a city that once promised to protect all the people of the world and shelter them in its embrace. These walls serve as a testament to the power of the people who held the remnants of Rome together into a flourishing and stable empire, a wellspring of art and culture, and a repository of the knowledge of the past that would pass its wealth onto the generations that came after. They stand as a symbol of the empire that never truly died but lives on today, ingrained in the fabric of the cultures of both East and West, Europe and Asia, Christian and Muslim, reaching back down the ages to the time of the ancients.
I want to end the episode with the lament written by the great Byzantine historian Niketas Koniates upon seeing the destruction of his city after its sacking by the Crusader army of 1204. Today, this lament stands as one of the most moving pieces of writing ever written about a lost and destroyed city, a wail of sorrow that speaks down to us through the ages. As you listen, try to imagine what it would have been like to be a citizen of Constantinople in the final days of its empire. Imagine what it would feel like to walk the abandoned streets of Constantine's city with its roof beams fallen in and olive trees growing among the patches of wasteland that now spread out between its sparse inhabited zones. Imagine what it must have felt like to walk its empty marketplaces and hollowed-out palaces, to run your hand along its ancient stones and see the sunlight fall on its faded murals, its glittering golden icons, and the earth-red tiles of its rooftops. Imagine seeing the sun set on the final days of Rome, as the light fades over the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara, over the rippling waters of the Bosporus, and for the final time, on the dying empire of Byzantium. City Fortified, City of the Great King, Tabernacle of the Most High, Praise and Song of His Servants and Beloved Refuge for Strangers, Queen of the Queens of Cities, Song of Songs and Splendour of Splendours and the Rarest Vision of the Rare Wonders of the World. Who is it that has torn us away from you like darling children from their adoring mother? What shall become of us? Where shall we go? What consolation shall we find in our nakedness, torn from your bosom as from a mother's womb? When shall we look on you, not as you now are, a plain of desolation and a valley of weeping, trampled by armies and despised and rejected, but exalted and restored, revered by those who humbled you and provoked you? As we left the city behind, I threw myself, just as I was, on the ground and reproached the walls. If what you were built to protect is no more, for what purpose do you still stand? We went forth, weeping and casting our lamentations like seeds. Thank you once again for listening to the Fall of Civilizations podcast.

In the year 1858, the French novelist Gustave Flaubert arrived in North Africa, hoping to find inspiration for his latest book. Flaubert was a seasoned traveler and a decade or so earlier had embarked on a grand tour of Cairo, Constantinople, Greece, and Italy. But the writer who now departed on this new set of travels was like a different man. Although only 37 years old, he was plagued by sickness and prone to fits of depression, and the novel he had been working on for the last year was threatening to drive him mad. The publication of his most famous work two years before, the novel Madame Bovary, had brought him fame and wealth, but now he was attempting to write a piece of fiction quite unlike anything he had ever attempted. It would be a story from classical history that took place in an empire that had once flourished in the north of Africa, had become the most powerful society in the ancient world, and then had vanished in its entirety more than 2,000 years ago, an empire that had been largely forgotten beside the more well-studied societies of classical Greece and Rome. This was the Empire of Carthage. He had spent the last months locked up in his study like a hermit, surrounded by the work of ancient historians trying to bring the lost city of Carthage back to life. But the writing just wouldn't come, as he wrote to his friend, Ernest Fadoe. I'm done for, my friend, done for. For the past month, I've found it impossible to write. I can't find a single word. Just think of what I've let myself in for, to resuscitate an entire civilization with nothing whatsoever to go on. Robert made the decision that something would have to change. He wrote of his intentions to his friend, Mademoiselle Leroyer de Chantepy. I absolutely must take a trip to Africa, so toward the end of March, I'll return to the land of dates. Once again, I'll live on horseback and sleep under a tent. I need only to go to El Kef and explore the environs of Carthage in order to acquaint myself thoroughly with the landscapes I'll be describing. When he arrived in Tunisia, Flaubert jotted down hurried impressions in his notebooks as he explored the ruins of the ancient cities of Utica and Carthage, now all but buried beneath the modern Tunisian capital of Tunis. In the green wheat full of flowering poppies, the road climbs little, sloping to the left and arrives at a valley, flat plains in the middle at a league's distance, ruins like palm trees, and here and there, blocks of masonry. We are walking on the remains of a Roman road. As he walked among the ruined walls of this ancient city, Flaubert felt himself connected to the ancient people he had been trying to write about, and saw ways of life that must have remained almost unchanged since the days of Carthage. In the south, the village of Sidi Bou Saïd, the sea behind, like a great block of indigo. All Carthage now stretches out before me, a camel on a terrace, turning a well. Flies are buzzing, weeds hang from the halls like chandeliers, a bird takes flight with the sound of a wing, another sings. Very fine dust, silence, green marks on the walls, livid and thick water in some basins. By the time he had finished his wanderings among the Carthaginian ruins of Tunisia, Flaubert had decided to completely rewrite the draft of his book, as he writes to Mademoiselle de Chantepierre. Everything I had done on my novel has to be done over. I was on the wrong track entirely, so it turns out that a little over a year since I first had the idea for the book, and after working hard on it most of that time, I am still only at the beginning. Armed with his Tunisian notebooks, Flaubert finished his book.
book four years later, and it was published under the title of Salambo. The book was an enormous success. It inspired plays and later even silent films, and it is credited with renewing public interest in a city and a culture that had once been considered a side note of history. As Flaubert walked those ruined walls and sunken harbors, as he kicked his way through the dust and scree of the crumbling city ruins, he must have asked himself again and again, what did it feel like to walk the streets of that ancient city? What was it like to see Carthage at the height of its golden age? And what would it have felt like to see this entire city, its streets and houses, its temples and theaters, its harbors and its homes, utterly destroyed and buried in dust and ash? My name's Paul Cooper and you're listening to the Fall of Civilizations podcast. Each episode, I look at a civilization of the past that rose to glory and then collapsed into the ashes of history. I want to ask, what did they have in common, what led to their fall, and what did it feel like to be a person alive at the time who witnessed the end of their world? In this episode, I want to tell one of the most dramatic stories to come down to us from the ancient world, the rise and fall of the Empire of Carthage. I want to show how this city rose out of the Phoenician states of the eastern Mediterranean and set out on voyages of discovery and settlement that put them at the center of the ancient world. I want to describe the unique culture that flourished on the shores of North Africa, and I want to tell the story of how the city of Carthage was destroyed and its memory nearly wiped from the earth. The Mediterranean Sea is a vast body of saltwater that lies between the continents of Europe and Africa. It's by far the largest inland sea on the planet, stretching around 4,000 kilometers from end to end. In the west, it's connected to the Atlantic Ocean by a thin opening at the Straits of Gibraltar. The coastline of this sea is more than 46,000 kilometers long, or enough to wrap around the entire circumference of the planet. This coastline has provided a home to countless cultures and civilizations over history. One of these cultures emerged on the easternmost corner of the Mediterranean coast, on a stony stretch of shore in what is today Lebanon, overlooked by towering mountains covered in cedar forest. Here, a series of city-states rose up more than 4,000 years ago that would give rise to a culture that would one day be called the Phoenicians. The largest of these cities were named Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos. Pinched as they were between the waves to the west and the forested mountains to the east, the territories they ruled over were never large, but this relatively isolated geography also meant that they were somewhat protected from invaders. The people we now think of as Phoenician wouldn't have ever used that word. Phoenician is a term invented later by their great rivals, the Greeks, and it's unclear if these cities ever thought of themselves as a unified people. They had a common Phoenician language and were united by the worship of certain gods, among them Baal-Haman, a heroic god named Melkart, and his wife Astarte. But there's very little in the historical record to suggest a common identity, architecture, or literature. Even the Greek word Phoenician
has a somewhat mysterious origin. The word phoenice is used to describe a particular colour of purple or crimson, and it is also used to describe a date palm, possibly due to the reddish colour of its fruit when ripe. And so, it's possible that the word came to be used as a result of one of the Phoenicians' earliest and most successful industries. The Phoenicians of Tyre and other cities were the first people to colour their clothes with a particular kind of dye derived from the bodies of predatory sea snails known as the murax or rock snail. These snails produce their dye as a defense mechanism against predators, and depending on the species, can produce a vivid red or purple colour quite unlike anything else available in the ancient world. From the moment these dyes were first used by Phoenicians around the 16th century BC, their colours became immediately sought after. But the process of producing these dyes was difficult and costly. It could take more than 50 kilograms of these snails to make a single gram of dye, and so these fabrics were extremely expensive. The colour purple would soon become associated with enormous wealth, and as a consequence, with royalty. This colour would be known as Tyrian purple, after the Phoenician city of Tyre, and later imperial purple. It would dye the robes of the emperors of Assyria, Rome, and later Byzantium. The first-century Roman writer Pliny the Elder writes about the effect this colour had on anyone who saw it. For purple, the rods and axes of Rome clear a path, and it likewise marks the dignity of boyhood. It distinguishes senator from noble, and it is summoned to secure the favour of the gods. It illuminates every garment, and on the triumphal robe, it is blended with gold. But why the price? It's possible then that the term phoenike came to be used by the Greeks to describe these traders from the rocky coast of Lebanon as the makers of purple, or the purple people. The name of the mythical creature the phoenix, an immortal bird with red feathers, also seems to derive from the same word. With their dye industry booming, the Phoenicians began to set out on ever longer voyages out into the Mediterranean Sea, all in search of ever more of these priceless snails. These longer voyages would require new developments in shipbuilding. Since as early as the third millennium BC, Phoenician sailors from the city of Byblos had developed ships with curved hulls, perfectly suited for traveling on the waves, and they had developed techniques for waterproofing the hulls of their ships using bitumen or pitch. In the Hebrew Bible, the 6th century BC Book of Ezekiel contains one poetic description of a Phoenician ship. They made all your timbers of juniper from Sinia. They took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you. Of oaks from Bashan, they made your oars. Of cypress wood from the coasts of Cyprus, they made your deck, adorned with ivory. Fine embroidered linen from Egypt was your sail and served as your banner. Your awnings were of blue and purple from the coasts of Elisha. The Phoenicians were also some of the earliest people to notice the pole star or polaris, a star that happens to align more or less perfectly with the rotational axis of the earth. This means that while all other stars appear to rotate in the sky throughout the night as the earth turns, the pole star remains more or less fixed in place. This made it exceptionally useful as a navigation tool, a fixed reference point in the sky. In Greek, this star would even come to be known as Phoenike, or the Phoenician star. The Phoenicians' early voyages around the Mediterranean led to them encountering many other peoples, and among these, they began to cultivate a reputation.
as uncompromising traders and shrewd gained them some degree of unpopularity. Homer's Odyssey, probably written down in the 7th or 8th century BC from even more ancient oral traditions, describes the Phoenicians as cunning and untrustworthy, in contrast to the supposedly noble Greeks. There they came, Phoenicians, men famed for their ships, greedy knaves bringing countless trinkets in their black ship. It seems the Phoenicians had become adept at metalworking, too. The following passage in Homer's Odyssey describes an ornate bowl brought by traders from the Phoenician city of Sidon. Then the son of Peleus set forth other prizes, a mixing bowl of silver, richly wrought in beauty far the goodliest in all the earth. Sidonians, well-skilled in deft handiwork, had wrought it cunningly. A man of the Phoenicians brought it over the murky deep and landed it in harbour. As a sea-faring people, the Phoenicians had a clear preference for building their cities on narrow, easily defended peninsulas and where possible on islands set just offshore. Their most influential city of Tyre was a perfect example, located on a small island just off the rocky coast. In the Hebrew Bible, the prophet Ezekiel gives us a sense of the trade that the people of Tyre drove with their surrounding neighbors. Tarshish did business with you because of your great wealth of goods. They exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your merchandise. Greece, Tubal, and Meshech did business with you. They traded human beings and articles of bronze for your wares. Men of Beth Tugama exchanged chariot horses, cavalry horses, and mules. Aram exchanged turquoise, purple fabric, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies. Judah and Israel traded with you. They exchanged wheat from minneth, honey, olive oil, and balm. While the natural defenses of their geography had kept cities like Tyre independent for much of their history, this wasn't to last forever. The first millennium BC was an age of iron and an age of empires, and soon the Phoenicians found themselves in a world of increasingly violent and aggressive neighbors. Perhaps the most terrifying of these was the power of the Assyrian Empire. From its heartlands in what is today Iraq, the Assyrian war machine would periodically stretch its power right to the coast of the Mediterranean and threaten to engulf the Phoenicians. One inscription from the palace of an Assyrian king gives just one example of the typical fate of a city conquered by the Assyrians. That city I destroyed, I flung my soldiers like lightning upon them. I piled up heaps of heads in front of his great gate, bands of captive soldiers I impaled on stakes on every side of his city. His palm trees I cut down, and from the city of Amidi, I departed. The Phoenicians had every reason to be nervous. At the start of the 8th century BC, the Assyrian king Adad-Nirari III conquered the territory of northern Syria, as he boasts in his royal palace inscriptions. Conquering from the Saluna mountain of the rising sun, and from the banks of the Euphrates, the country of Hatti, Amurra in its full extent, the land of Tyre, the land of Sidon, the land of Israel, the land of Edom, the land of Philistia, I made them submit to my feat, imposing upon them tribute. The Assyrians were now breathing directly down the necks of the Phoenician cities of the coast. But as time went on, the Phoenicians were able to carve out a niche for themselves that ensured they were quite simply too useful for the Assyrians to destroy. The Mediterranean Sea had
long been an insurmountable challenge to many of the region's great powers. The Assyrians referred to it as Id Marati, or the Bitter River, which they believed to flow around the whole earth, while the Egyptians referred to it as Wadj-Wer, or the Great Green. These empires were freshwater river cultures and navigated the waters of their rivers in flat-bottomed barges. For this reason, they had always remained wary of the rougher waters of the sea. Assyria relied heavily on many of the commodities brought into the region by Phoenician traders, incense, silver, and purple dye for their palaces, bronze and iron for their armies. And so, Assyria offered the cities of Tyre and Sidon something of a deal. They would be allowed a degree of independence so long as they ensured a constant flow of metals and other resources into Assyria, and so long as they acted as a kind of navy for hire, providing their ships and sailors to Assyria in times of war. The Phoenicians had little choice but to accept. But there was one problem. The Assyrian demands for metal were truly staggering, and if they were going to be met, it would require a drastic expansion of the Phoenician trade network. At first, the Phoenicians set up simple trading posts anywhere they could find good supplies of metal. Archaeology shows they set up communities in Cyprus to take advantage of its rich stores of copper, and in Sardinia, the Mediterranean's second-largest island, rich in copper, iron, silver, and lead. At these sites, local people usually did all the actual mining, while the Phoenicians simply turned up to buy the goods and take them away by ship. From Cyprus and Sardinia, Phoenician sailors pushed on into the west of the Mediterranean and set up the small colony of Utica in North Africa, and even reached southern Spain where they found that the mines practically overflowed with silver, iron, and other metals. Archaeologists have found huge Phoenician furnaces in this region, designed for smelting metal ingots for transportation on an industrial scale, all to satisfy the demands of the fearsome Assyrian kings. Before long, the Phoenicians were sailing out through the Straits of Gibraltar, then known as the Pillars of Hercules, and out into the Atlantic Ocean. They set up a colony at Lyxus on the western coast of Morocco and pushed further down the coast to settle what is now the Moroccan port town of Essaouira, more than 4,000 kilometers from their homeland. To finance these expeditions, the Phoenicians developed innovative monetary systems that in some ways represented a form of ancient capitalism. Phoenician society was dominated by powerful trading firms, usually run by a certain family, and they pioneered the use of interest-bearing loans for voyages, even developing maritime insurance policies which paid out if your ships were destroyed in a storm or plundered by pirates. But perhaps the greatest of their innovations was something that we use every day, and that is the alphabet. Up until that point, writing had been a cumbersome and difficult task. The cuneiform writing systems that had been developed by the Sumerians thousands of years before and the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians were both difficult to learn and relied on the services of a learned class of scribes who spent years of their lives learning them. But the Phoenician alphabet was a master class in simplicity. It had only 22 letters and could be used to spell out words phonetically, leaving out any vowels. Quite ingeniously, the shapes of the letters also gave a clue as to how they were pronounced. Their letter B, for instance, was named bet, which was the Phoenician word for house, and its symbol was drawn with a pointed roof. This simplicity drastically reduced the amount of time it took to learn and meant that common traders and merchants may have had some ability to read and write and to keep records, essential for the complex business
of buying and selling across the sea. The Phoenician alphabet was such a good idea that it was adopted almost wholesale by the Greeks, as the Greek historian Herodotus recounts. These Phoenicians who came with Cadmus brought with them to Greece, among many other kinds of loaning, the alphabet. As time went on, the sound and form of the letters were changed and after being taught the letters by the Phoenicians, the Greeks who were settled around them used them with a few changes of form. With the addition of some letters for vowels, what resulted was the Greek alphabet which means that the Phoenician writing system is the foundation of all Western alphabets used today. The earliest piece of Phoenician writing was found on an inscribed tablet known as the Nora Stone unearthed in Sardinia, apparently commemorating a Phoenician captain who may have died in conflict with the local people. He fought with the Sardinians at Tarshish and he drove them out. Among the Sardinians, he is now at peace and his army is at peace. Milchaton, son of Shubna, general of King Pumae. But for the most part, the Phoenicians seemed to have interacted with the people they met relatively peacefully, and most of all, profitably. Before long, the cities of Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos found themselves at the far east of a sprawling trade network. Keeping such a loose and disparate collection of colonies together was no easy task, but it seems that here, the Phoenician religion played a key role. The people of Tyre worshipped a heroic god known as Melkart, a warrior hero who the Greeks would later associate with Hercules. Temples to Melkart were set up at multiple Phoenician trading posts and most had an olive tree, a symbol of the city of Tyre, growing in their central courtyard. The grandest of these temples was built at the furthest Phoenician colony from Tyre, then known as Gardiz, what is now the Spanish city of Cadiz. This colony sat on the Atlantic coast just outside the Straits of Gibraltar, but it made up for its extreme distance from Tyre with its immense opulence. At the center of the temple stood an olive tree with its branches and leaves wrought out of solid gold, holding emerald fruits in its branches. Women were forbidden entry to the temple, as were pigs, and the priests of Melkart went barefoot, wearing a band of Egyptian flax over their bare heads. The Greek geographer Strabo recounts the following description of the settlement of Gardiz. Now, these islands are this side of what are called the Pillars of Heracles. Gardiz, however, is outside the Pillars. Here live the men who fit out the most and largest merchant vessels, both for our sea and the outer sea. They say the Tyrians believed that the two capes which formed the Strait were the ends of the inhabited world. A great ceremony known as the Ejercis, or awakening, was conducted each year in the temple of Gardiz. During this time, all foreigners were asked to leave the city and a great effigy of the god Melkart was set afloat on the sea and burned. Even this temple was a crucial part of the Phoenician trading system. The institution worked to guarantee the quality of metal ingots produced in Gardiz by giving them a special stamp and acted as a guarantor between merchants entering into contracts, with punishments promised from Melkart himself if any dared to go back on their word. With Phoenician trade increasingly drifting westward, the center of their power would soon also shift in that direction, to a place where they would finally be free of the overbearing empires constantly breathing down their necks. They would soon found a city on the shore of North Africa, right at the center of the Mediterranean world, a city that would become one of the largest and wealthiest on earth. That city would one day be known
as Carthage. Like so many aspects of our modern understanding of the Phoenicians, the name Carthage is itself a distortion filtered through the accounts of others. In Latin, the city was known as Carthago, while the Greeks called it Carcadon. But to its inhabitants, it was known as Carthadast, or in Phoenician, the new city. Like many great cities of its time, Carthage soon developed its own founding myth. It begins with a princess of Tyre named Elissa or Elishaia. In the legend, the king of Tyre promises that upon his death, his kingdom would be split between his two children, his daughter Elishaia and his son Pygmalion. But when the old king dies, the treacherous brother Pygmalion refuses to accept the splitting of the kingdom and moves to seize everything for himself, even killing Elishaia's husband to remove any potential rivals. Stricken with grief, Elishaia flees down to the docks along with a ragtag band of her royal guards and temple women, and there they set sail westwards and make for Africa. The Roman writer Justinus, drawing on an earlier Greek text, writes his rendition of this story, along with a cunning deception to slow down any greedy pursuers. Elissa put the attendants who were sent by the king to assist in her removal on board some vessels in the early part of the evening, and sailing out into the deep made them throw some loads of sand put up in sacks as if it was money into the sea. This group of refugees sail along the coast of North Africa until eventually they set ashore near the Phoenician colony of Utica. They camp on a nearby hill known as Birsa, and the king who rules there, a man named Yarbus, takes pity on them. But not too much pity. He offers to sell them a plot of land on the hill no bigger than an ox hide. But Elishaia is cunning. She cuts the ox hide into thin strips, lining them up to enclose the entire hill, a much larger area of land than the miserly king had intended. Bound by his word, Yarbus has no choice but to give them the land he promised, and so the city of Carthage is born. Justinus recounts the city's early flourishing. Carthage was founded, an annual tribute being fixed for the ground which it was to occupy. At the commencement of digging the foundations, an ox's head was found, which was an omen that the city would be wealthy indeed, but laborious and always enslaved. It was therefore removed to another place, where the head of a horse was found, which, indicating that the people would be warlike and powerful, portended an auspicious sight. In a short time, as the surrounding people came together at the report, the inhabitants became numerous, and the city itself extensive. From the hilltop of Birsa, the city grows and grows, soon eclipsing King Yarbus' town of Utica, which makes him understandably jealous. He demands that Elisha marry him so that he can absorb her flourishing town and everything she owns into his kingdom. If she refuses, he will burn Carthage to the ground. Faced with the choice of this capitulation or the destruction of her new city, Elisha builds a great pyre and climbs onto it, saying that she must indeed go to her husband, meaning not Yarbus but the man her brother had killed on the other side of the sea, waiting for her in the afterlife. This tragic but noble self-sacrifice has proven irresistible to generations of poets, and the Roman poet Virgil gives one rendition of this scene. When the pyre of cut pine and oak was raised high in an innermost court open to the sky, the queen hung the place with garlands and wreathed it with funereal foliage. She laid his sword and clothes and picture on the bed. She lingered a while, in tears and thought, then cast herself on the bed and spoke her last words.
words, accept this soul and loose me from my sorrows. In honor of Elishaia's sacrifice, her people gave her the title of Dido, meaning female warrior or heroine, and this is the name by which she would be known to later Roman writers. This Baroque tale of love and tragedy has all the hallmarks of ancient literature and we can't assume that it bears any relationship to what actually happened. Some details of the tale do accord with what archaeology tells us, that the Carthaginian Phoenicians drew their origins back to the city of Tyre and that the city was founded close to the older settlement of Utica which it soon eclipsed in size. But perhaps more important than any of this is the sense that this founding myth might give us of the way the Carthaginians thought of themselves and their city's place in the world. As a city of survivors who had found refuge here on the North African coast, a city of sailors and adventurers, they were resourceful and drove a hard bargain. They were clever, fond of outwitting their enemies, always finding a way to make a little go a long way, and also, perhaps, that they would die before they gave up their freedom. Regardless of the truth of its origins, it's clear from archaeology that after its founding in the 8th century BC, the new colony of Carthage did grow exceptionally quickly. In many ways, it was the perfect Phoenician settlement. Carthage was built in a small bay that itself belonged to a vast natural harbour known today as the Bay of Tunis. The city sat on top of a series of sheer red cliffs that look down over the glittering blue waters of the Mediterranean in the north. It was also easily defended on its landward side where a range of rocky hills and a number of lakes and saltwater lagoons break the land into a series of narrow approaches, protecting the city from any would-be attackers. The Roman writer Appian writes one description of the city's location. The city lay in a recess of a great gulf and was in the form of a peninsula. It was separated from the mainland by an isthmus about five kilometers in width. From this isthmus, a narrow and longish tongue of land, about a kilometer wide, extended towards the west between a lake and the sea. Near to the site of Carthage flows a river known today as the Medgerda which originates in the high Atlas Mountains of North Africa. This river flows for 460 kilometers to the sea and brings crucial freshwater into the bay, turning the otherwise arid landscape green and providing water for drinking and for irrigation. As a result, the land here was abundant with wheat, grapes, olives, and dates. In the distance over the bay to the south rises the blue outline of the mountain Jebel Rassas, literally the Mountain of Lead, a rugged outcrop of Jurassic limestone climbing nearly 800 meters above the plain. The hot desert winds known as the Sirocco would blow in from the Sahara during the summer season, rattling the shutters on the windows and the leaves of the date palms. At the end of summer, thunderstorms would roll in from the sea. As well as its ideal geography, the city's location in the Mediterranean world was also perfect. Carthage sat at a crucial halfway point between the city of Tyre and the wealthy mines of Spain, but it was also only about 200 kilometers by boat from the island of Sicily and about 300 kilometers from Sardinia, two crucial sites of Phoenician industry that were only growing in importance. Pottery found in even the earliest layers of Carthage shows a huge range of styles coming from Greece, Italy, Spain, and all the Phoenician colonies. The Phoenician world was now a web, with Carthage sitting right at its center. The city in these early days must have been a humble site. Archaeology paints a picture of a simple collection of mud-brick buildings lining the seashore, but within a century, this had exploded. One graveyard
soon had to be moved in order to make space for a quarter filled with metal working workshops, and the settlers built a wall about three meters in height to protect their burgeoning town. Soon, more monumental buildings would be constructed. The Roman poet Virgil imagines the activity that must have accompanied the growth of this town from tiny settlement to booming city. Aeneas found where lately huts had been, marvelous buildings, gateways, cobbled ways, and din of wagons. There the Tyrians were hard at work, laying courses for walls, rolling up stones to build the citadel, while others picked out building sites and plowed a boundary furrow. Laws were being enacted, magistrates and a sacred Senate chosen. Here men were dredging harbors, there they laid the foundations of a theater, and quarried massive pillars. Other than what we can glean from archaeology, we know very little about the early history of Carthage. Apart from a few short inscriptions, no Carthaginian texts have survived into the modern day, and so in terms of written history, we have virtually complete silence from that part of the Mediterranean for the first 200 years or so of its existence, and beyond that, we have to rely on the writings of others. From the work of Greek writers, we learn that Carthage was a republic. It was ruled under a kind of oligarchic system governed by a council of its wealthiest citizens. The Greek philosopher Aristotle, writing in the 4th century, spoke approvingly of the Carthaginian system of government and compares it to that of the Greek city-state of Sparta. Carthage also appears to have a good constitution, with many outstanding features as compared with those of other nations, but most nearly resembling the Spartan in some points. Many regulations at Carthage are good, and a proof of a well-regulated constitution is that the populace willingly remain faithful to the constitutional system, and that neither civil strife has arisen in any degree worth mentioning, nor yet a tyrant. But Aristotle also warns that the Carthaginian system put too much emphasis on the wealth of its rulers rather than their competence, and expresses concerns that this could lead to corruption. Those who purchase their office will learn by degrees to make a profit out of it. The highest echelons of Carthaginian society were divided between the civil leaders, the shofotim or judges, and the rabim or generals, who took care of military matters. These highest positions, senators and the heads of committees, drew no salary for their work, and so they could realistically only be held by those who could support themselves on private incomes, usually successful merchants or wealthy landowners. But there was a certain fairness to this. There seems to have been no barrier other than wealth, and people from common backgrounds who became wealthy could quickly rise to the highest parts of government. Certain powerful families were constantly vying for the most powerful positions, but there was no hereditary royalty in Carthage. It's possible that the myth of Elishaia or Dido may have played a role in maintaining this situation, since according to the legend, the city was founded by a woman who had no children. No one could ever claim to be her true descendants or have any kind of ancestral right to rule. Instead, the city was governed by a number of different semi-democratic bodies made up of wealthy citizens. One of these was called the Tribunal of the 104, and another the Council of Elders, a kind of Senate. The highest executive position was held by two elected officers who ruled simultaneously and who were elected each year. The arrangement was complex and likely prone to corruption, but for the most part, it seems to have worked.
have worked. While Carthage flourished, the Phoenician cities that had given birth to it began to flounder. Tyre and Sidon were still under the boot of Assyria, and around 670 BC, the Assyrian king Esarhaddon began to place harsh restrictions on who they could trade with. When Assyria went to war with Egypt, Esarhaddon forced the Phoenicians of Tyre to place a trade embargo on the Pharaohs. Without access to their once most lucrative market, these cities went into decline. Soon, the king of Tyre was not even allowed to open messages without an Assyrian official present, as the following surviving fragment of one treaty shows. "...Nor must you open a letter which I send you without the presence of the Royal deputy. If the Royal deputy is absent, wait for him and then open it. If a ship of the people of Tyre is shipwrecked off the coast of the land of the philistines or anywhere on the borders of Assyrian territory, everything that is on the ship belongs to Esarhaddon, king of Assyria." As a result of the decline of cities like Tyre and Sidon, it's likely that large numbers of Phoenicians would have fled to what was now the undisputed capital of the Phoenician world, the booming port town of Carthage. They brought with them their language, their knowledge, their gods, and their gold. By the 6th century BC, Carthage was one of the largest and wealthiest cities in the Mediterranean, and its sailors, the finest in the world, would soon embark on voyages of exploration that would not be matched for another 2,000 years. By this time, the Phoenicians had already sailed right to the end of their world, through the pillars of Hercules and out into the Atlantic Ocean. But their exploration didn't stop there. In fact, if ancient sources are to be believed, they may have been the first navigators to successfully sail around the entire coast of Africa. Herodotus recounts one expedition that supposedly took place around 600 BC, sponsored by a pharaoh of Egypt named Nekos, although he is frustratingly vague and short on detail. The expedition apparently set sail from Egypt's Red Sea coast, voyaged around the Horn of Africa and the South African Cape before sailing north through the Gulf of Guinea and back into the Mediterranean through the pillars of Hercules. Nekos of Egypt sent Phoenicians in ships, instructing them to sail on their return voyage past the pillars of Heraclith until they came into the Northern Sea, and so to Egypt. So, the Phoenicians set out from the Red Sea and sailed to the Southern Sea. Whenever autumn came, they would put in and plant the land in whatever part of Libya they had reached, and there await the harvest. Then, having gathered the crop, they sailed on, so that after two years had passed, it was in the third that they rounded the pillars of Heraclith and came to Egypt. There they said, what some may believe though I do not, that in sailing around Libya, they had the sun on their right hand. Interestingly, it is this detail that Herodotus personally finds unbelievable that has caused modern scholars to take the claim more seriously. The change in the position of the sun relative to the ship suggests that the voyage did indeed cross the Tropic of Cancer and perhaps even the equator, causing the summer sun to appear in the north. Modern estimates consider a journey time of three years to be a reasonable duration for a circumnavigation of Africa that would have been about 20,000 kilometers long, or half the way around the world. If this story is true, then it means the Phoenicians may have rounded the Cape of Africa more than 2,000 years before the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias would do the same thing in 1488, opening up the passage to India and the age of European colonialism. More solidly attested voyages of Phoenician discovery
would see an explorer named Hanno the Navigator sail out into the Atlantic Ocean through the Pillars of Hercules and sail perhaps as far south as Cameroon or Gabon in West Africa. His voyage is recounted in a Greek translation entitled The Periplus or Travel Account of Hanno, supposedly an accurate copy of an inscription that actually hung in the temple of Baal Hamon in Carthage. It was decreed by the Carthaginians that Hanno should undertake a voyage beyond the Pillars of Hercules and found Phoenician cities. We sailed accordingly with 60 ships of 50 oars each and the body of men and women to the number of 30,000 and provisions and other necessaries. Preceding a day's sail we came to the extremity of the lake that was overhung by large mountains inhabited by savage clothed in the skins of wild beasts who drove us away by throwing stones and hindered us from landing. Sailing thence, we came to another river that was large and broad and full of crocodiles and hippopotamuses. Hanno writes down vivid descriptions of seeing active volcanoes spewing lava into the ocean, possibly the active volcano Mount Cameroon. And then quickly sailing forth, we passed by a burning country full of fragrance from which great torrents of fire flowed down to the sea and we sailed along with all speed being stricken by fear. After a journey of four days, we saw the land at night covered with flames and in the midst there was one lofty fire, greater than the rest, which seemed to touch the stars. Hanno even seems to have been the first to write down an encounter with what may have been Earth's largest living primates, with unfortunate results. We arrived at a bay called the Southern Horn, at the bottom of which lay an island full of savage people, the greater part of whom were women, whose bodies were hairy and whom our interpreters called gorillae. Though we pursued the men, we could not seize any of them, but all fled from us, escaping over the precipices and defending themselves with stones. Three women were however taken, but they attacked their conductors with their teeth and hands and could not be prevailed upon to accompany us. Having killed them, we flayed them and brought their skins with us to Carthage. We did not sail farther on, our provisions failing us. These hairy creatures may have been chimpanzees, monkeys, or what we today would call gorillas, all of which can be encountered in the region of Cameroon. On Hanno's return, the hairy skins he brought home were kept in the temple to the god Tanit in Carthage and according to Pliny the Elder, would remain in the city for as long as it existed. In the 19th century, when the American physician and missionary Thomas Stoughton Savage and the naturalist Jeffreys Wyman wrote the first scientific description of a gorilla, they gave them the name Troglodytes Gorilla after the mysterious description in Hanno's writing, and the name has stuck ever since. Another explorer named Himilco sailed out into the Atlantic and went in the opposite direction, sailing north up the coast of Spain and France, and even on to the British Isles. Here, he saw Celtic tribespeople sailing in coracles made of deer skin, a sight he found remarkable. They cleave the tempestuous sea and the current of the ocean, abounding in monsters with woven boats. Indeed, these people do not know how to fashion keels with pine and maple, but in a miraculous thing, they always fit out vessels from hides stretched together and often travel through the immense sea in a skin. Himilco also brought back stories of the vast expanse of the Atlantic to the west, a frightening sight to the sailors brought up in the enclosed inland sea of the Mediterranean. Beyond, towards the area to the west, there is a sea without end. The ocean lies open across a wide area and the sea stretches out. No man has entered upon these seas because the sea lacks winds that would drive the ships along.
and no breeze from the sky favors a ship. It also seems that he may have seen whales swimming out there in the ocean, which were then nearly four times more numerous than they are today. Here and there, see monsters swim amid the slow ships sluggishly crawling along. Himilco reported that he had once seen these creatures in the ocean and proved their existence. These we have related to you, revealed a long time ago deep in the annals of the Carthaginians. In 2019, a team of 20 modern sailors successfully piloted a replica of a single-masted Carthaginian merchant vessel across the Atlantic Ocean, departing from the site of Carthage and landing in the Caribbean five months later, demonstrating that Phoenician ships had the ability to reach the Americas 2,000 years before Columbus. As the city of Carthage grew, its population boomed. While some ancient writers record it as having a population of more than 700,000 people, this is thought to be unlikely. But estimates based on the size of the city and the size of civilian armies drawn up in times of crisis, have suggested that the population may have reached 400,000. By the year 400 BC, the city walls had been rebuilt to now stand a towering 15 meters high, with a triple line of ditches and defenses on the landward side. The hill of Birsa, where legend has it that Elishaia played her trick with the oxhide, was now itself ringed with an inner defensive wall and loomed over the rest of the city as a fortified citadel. The Roman writer Appian writes the following description of the city. On the seaside, the city was protected by a single wall. Toward the south in the mainland, where the citadel of Birsa stood on the Ithmus, there was a triple wall. The height of each wall was 15 meter without counting parapets and towers, which were separated from each other by a space of 60 meters. One of the most remarkable features of ancient Carthage was the innovative design of its harbour known as the Cothon. Likely built sometime in the third or second century BC, this comprised a large rectangular commercial harbour for civilian ships that led into a unique circular docking bay for the military ships of Carthage's war fleet. The harbour was so large that today the shape of its outline can still be seen in the coast of the city of Tunis. Appian describes the unique design of this harbour. The harbours had communication with each other and a common entrance from the sea 20 meters wide, which could be closed with iron chains. The first port was for merchant vessels and here were collected all kinds of ships' tackle. Within the second port was an island which, together with the port itself, was enclosed by high embankments. These embankments were full of shipyards which had capacity for 220 vessels. Above them were magazines for their tackle and furniture. Two ionic columns stood in front of each dock. On the island was built the admiral's house from which the trumpeter gave signals, the herald delivered orders, and the admiral himself overlooked everything. At this time, Carthage had the largest and most powerful fleet in the Mediterranean, and the military port was built to conceal the ships docked within and ensure that no spies could glean any of their secrets or keep tabs on their movements. The island lay near the entrance to the harbour and rose to a considerable height so that the admiral could observe what was going on at sea, while those who were approaching by water could not get any clear view of what took place within. Not even the incoming merchants could see the docks, for a double wall enclosed them and there were gates by which merchant ships could pass from the first port to the city without traversing the dockyards. Such was the appearance of Carthage at the time. Between the harbour and the citadel of Birsa on the hill stood the Ogon.
the large open marketplace of the city where all manner of goods and foods could be bought. Archaeological studies of plant matter found in Carthage show that the ancient Carthaginians enjoyed a varied diet. Walking through the markets of the city, you would be able to buy wheat, barley, and other grains, numerous vegetables like artichokes and cabbages, pulses and lentils, and fruits including pomegranates, grapes, figs, olives, peaches, plums, and melons, as well as nuts like pistachios and almonds. Olives were pressed into oil and its people ate fish like grey mullet, sea perch, eels, and dolphins, as well as the meat of sheep, pigs, goats, chickens, and occasionally even dogs. The Carthaginians, like most people in the ancient world, were obsessed with a pungent, salty sauce known as garum which was brewed from the fermenting of fish entrails and which was probably similar to the fish sauce used today in East Asian cuisine. In the wreck of one Carthaginian ship found off the coast of Sicily in Marsala, archaeologists have also uncovered the remains of cannabis stalks which may have been chewed by the ship's rowers and could also have been enjoyed on land, either chewed or brewed into a tea. Wine was particularly beloved too, and especially a particular kind of sweet dessert wine made from sun-dried grapes. One agricultural handbook written by a Carthaginian named Margo has survived in fragments of Greek and Latin translation and it describes the process of making this wine. Pick some well-ripened early grapes. Discard any that are mildewed or damaged. Lay down reeds and spread the grapes out in the sun on top. Cover them at night so that the dew will not moisten them. When they are dried, pick the grapes off stems and put them in a jar or pitcher. Add some unfermented wine, the best you have, until the grapes are just covered. After six days when the grapes have absorbed it all and are swollen, put them in a basket, put them through the press, and collect the resulting liquid. Bottle the liquid in stopper jars and after 20 or 30 days when the fermentation is over, coat the lids with plaster and cover them with leather. As a typical Phoenician city, Carthage initially had a small footprint in North Africa and in its early days it was reliant on its overseas territories in Sardinia and Sicily for more than half of its food brought across the sea on grain ships. But in the 6th century, it began to expand its territory around the city. The Carthaginians either expelled local people or came to agreements with them and built a network of towns and forts to the south, east, and west, and began to farm the land themselves. A later writer, Diodorus of Sicily, would pen the following description of the abundant hinterland that would soon stretch beyond the city. All the lands were set with gardens and orchards watered by numerous springs and canals. There were well-constructed country houses built with lime along the route, announcing widespread wealth. The land was cultivated with vines, olive trees, and a whole host of fruit trees. On both sides, there were herds of oxen and sheep grazing on the plain, and near the main pastures and the marshes, there were studs of horses. In its outposts in Sardinia, Spain, and Sicily, Carthage began a similar process, turning what had once been small trading posts into more solid and fortified territories with their own agricultural land. Soon, the city of Carthage would be more or less self-sufficient, as the Roman writer Appian describes. Gradually acquiring strength, they mastered Africa and the greater part of the Mediterranean, carried war into Sicily and Sardinia, and the other islands of that sea, and also into Spain. They sent out numerous colonies. They became a match for the Greeks in power and next to the Persians in wealth. The typical Carthaginian house was built around a central courtyard, and the wealthier dwellings had an upstairs and a terrace. Finer houses had cupboards and shelves built into the walls, and often a clay bread oven. We can imagine that this was the home of the Carthaginians, and the Carthaginians were the first to build a house in the middle of the Carthaginian plain.
the smells of this baking bread along with the pungent aromas from the tanneries and wineries, the smells of animals and incense, cooked fish, and salty garum sauce. Wealthy houses also contained elaborate bathrooms with separate changing facilities, and baths plastered with water-resistant stucco. Before bathing, oil would be applied to the body, and a bronze tool known as a strigil was used to scrape dirt from the skin. While in Greek houses, these bathrooms were usually built off the kitchen, the Carthaginians built their bathrooms next to the entrance to the house, suggesting that there was some sort of ritual purpose to the bathing, separating the dusty, unclean world of outside from the clean inner space of the home. A variety of animals would have been visible on the crowded city streets. These would have included beasts of burden like oxen and horses, stray dogs and cats, and noisy caravans of donkeys coming in from the desert. But they also seem to have drawn animals as curiosities from all parts of Africa. A species of huge lion known as the Barbary lion could be found all across this region and would later be captured for spectacles, including in the Roman arenas. A species of monkey known as the Barbary macaque is also native to this area. Diodorus of Sicily records one account of Carthaginians keeping these monkeys as apparently much beloved pets. In these cities, many of the customs were very different from those current among us. For the apes lived in the same houses as the men, being regarded among them as gods, just as the dogs are among the Egyptians. And from the provisions laid up in the storerooms, the beasts took their food without hindrance whenever they wished. For any who killed this animal as if he had committed the greatest sacrilege, death was established as the penalty. Around this time, monkeys began appearing as a motif in the art of regions of Italy, Sardinia, and elsewhere, suggesting that the Carthaginians were even exporting this animal to other regions. Some Barbary macaques were mummified in Egyptian tombs alongside pharaohs, and the skull of a Barbary macaque dated to around this time has even been unearthed as far away as Northern Ireland. Of course, in vast stables to the south of the city were kept the animals that in most people's minds are most inseparably associated with the city of Carthage, that is, the elephant. The North African elephant is an extinct subspecies of the African elephant that lived north of the Sahara desert. Carthaginian paintings on walls, coins, and mosaics show that these elephants had the swooping backs and large ears typical of the African elephant that roamed the savannah, but it was considerably smaller and was likely similar in size to another surviving subspecies, the African forest elephant. These reach a shoulder height of about two and a half meters, only a little taller than the largest shire horses. But of course, their thick and heavy frames mean they weigh more than 15 times the average horse. For this reason, these elephants were used by the Carthaginians as fearsome weapons of war. Some historians have speculated that Carthage may also have imported some much larger Indian elephants, which were at that time being used by the Seleucid dynasty in Syria. One elephant that was the pride of the later Carthaginian army was known by the name Souros, which some have translated to mean the Syrian. If true, this Syrian elephant would have towered as much as a meter over the smaller Carthaginian elephants and would have been a truly terrifying sight on the battlefield. In India and Southeast Asia, it has always been common to use elephants as work animals to transport heavy loads for construction, but it's not clear whether the Carthaginians used their elephants in this manner or whether these precious animals were only reserved for their power and prestige to be used as living tanks on the battlefield, as the writer Pliny the
Elder describes. Elephants when tamed are employed in war and carry into the ranks of the enemy towers filled with armed men, and on them in a very great measure depends the ultimate result of the battles that are fought in the East. They tread underfoot whole companies and crush the men in their armour. But I think it's not hard to imagine that, as in India, elephants may also have been used ceremonially in festivals and parades to carry kings and generals, a living embodiment of the might of this new empire. While Carthage didn't hesitate to go to war to defend its interests and protect its trade, it was not at heart a warrior culture, and it never suffered a conflict to continue any longer than it absolutely had to. The Carthaginians often relied on diplomatic solutions and agreements to avoid fighting with their various neighbours in the Mediterranean. One such agreement was settled in the year 509 BC with a minor city-state in central Italy, in the region of Latium, whose people spoke a small Italic dialect called Latin. This city's people had just that year thrown off the rule of their Etruscan king and abolished kingship in the city for good. In place of a king, they had brought in the rule of a pair of elected consuls drawn from the aristocracy, a system strikingly similar to and perhaps even inspired by the Carthaginians. This city's name was Rome. The Romans at that time were among several powers in central Italy, facing rivals in the Etruscans to the north and powerful tribal confederacies like the Samnites, all fighting for dominance in the plains of central Italy. The Carthaginians seem to have taken note of this regional development and proceeded to sign a treaty with this new Roman republic, the contents of which the Greek historian Polybius records. There shall be friendship between the Romans and their allies, and the Carthaginians and their allies, on these conditions. Neither the Romans nor their allies are to sail beyond the fair peninsula unless driven by stress of weather or the fear of enemies. If any one of them be driven ashore, he shall not buy or take anything for himself save what is needed for the repair of his ship and the service of the gods, and he shall depart within five days. Carthage shall build no fort in Laetium, and if they enter the district in arms, they shall not stay a night therein. The theme of this treaty was simple. You leave us alone, and we will leave you alone. While Rome was at this point very much on the Carthaginians' radar, it seems that they considered this Italian city-republic to be little cause of concern. Around the year 410 BC, Carthage began minting its own silver coins, and each coin would be stamped with the symbol of a palm tree, in Greek known as phoenike, now becoming a symbol of Phoenician identity. Carthage was now presenting itself as the new champion of the Phoenician people, the capital of the Phoenician world. It was now beginning to look a lot like an empire, and like all empires, it soon found an increasing need to defend and expand its territory. It's often said that Carthage relied on mercenaries to fight its wars, but this is something of an oversimplification. While these kinds of armies for hire did make up one part of their forces, in fact, there were all kinds of reasons that people came to fight for the Empire of Carthage. Many of their soldiers were sent to fight for them as part of treaties, just as the Phoenicians had once promised to send their ships to fight for Assyria. As Carthage expanded to conquer new peoples all along the North African coast and across the Mediterranean, ever more power and variety was added to its forces. When war came, each ally and province would send fighters of a particular kind based on what they specialized in.
in. The North African power of Numidia experienced cavalry and javelin throwers, while colonies in the island of Majorca would send slingers, and peasant spearmen with large round shields were conscripted from the fields of Libya in the east. Celts from Spain made up some part of their forces, and sometimes even Greeks and Italians ended up fighting in these armies. There was only one group of people who hardly ever fought for Carthage, and that was the citizens of Carthage themselves. The Carthaginian system relied largely on making life as comfortable as possible for the people of the capital. Few Carthaginian politicians ever risked the unpopular move of conscripting its citizens into the army, and so they amassed their forces out of units brought from all the four corners of the empire. Each army of Carthage was its own unique patchwork and would have spoken dozens of different languages. As the Greek historian Polybius writes, it was therefore impossible to assemble them and address them as a body or to do so by any other means, for how could any general be expected to know all their languages? Again, to address them through several interpreters repeating the same thing four or five times was, if anything, more impractical. It was a system that had many weaknesses, but it allowed the empire to raise large armies at short notice, and it meant that since they could never be accused of sending good Carthaginian men to die, the politicians of the city were largely insulated from the consequences of going to war. But soon, these armies would find themselves embroiled in a bitter struggle that would test this system to its breaking point and threaten to bring the whole empire to the brink of destruction. These wars would erupt over what would soon become the most fought over piece of land in the Mediterranean, that is, the island of Sicily. Sicily is the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It sits off the southern end of Italy, separated by the narrow waters of the Straits of Messina, only three kilometers wide at its narrowest point. Sicily's most prominent landmark is the volcano Mount Etna, towering at 3,000 meters over its eastern coast. Due to the island's particularly violent geology, this is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. Although we think of it today as part of Europe, Sicily is actually on the northern edge of the African continental plate, right at the impact point where the European plate is grinding it downwards into the earth's mantle. The collision of these titanic forces means that Mount Etna erupts an average 200 times every year. The volcanic ash spewed by this volcano gives the soil of Sicily an incredible fertility, meaning that its farmlands have always been rich. At first, Carthage enjoyed an unrivaled position on the island, trading with the Sicilian locals in the west, just a short hop away from their capital in Africa. But soon, they would come into conflict with another group of people that for much of this history would be their greatest rivals on the sea and the land, a people who were at the same time also busy establishing colonies across the Mediterranean. These were the Greeks. The Greeks, like the Phoenicians, were expert sailors and had built a number of thriving colonies in southern Italy, in what is now Turkey and in the Black Sea. Beginning in the 8th century BC, Greek explorers and traders began expanding their interests onto the island of Sicily. Like the Phoenicians, the Greeks at this time weren't a unified people. They spoke four different dialects of Greek and countless sub-dialects, and came from dozens of independent city states and island kingdoms that often fought with each other more bitterly than with any foreigners. But despite these internal divisions, the Greeks would expand
across the southern portion of Italy and Sicily, and joined up this series of colonies into an area that they would call Megale Helas, or Greater Greece. Wherever they went, Greek settlers were in part inspired by the myth of their hero, Heracles, who the Romans would call Hercules. He was a half-divine warrior who traveled the length and breadth of Europe, performing his famous twelve labors, and meanwhile performing great deeds wherever he passed through. Wherever a new Greek colony sprung up around the Mediterranean, a new installment of the Hercules myth would quickly be added to show that this had also been one of his stops. In some places, he was celebrated for slaying giants and mythical beasts, while in others his feats were more mundane. In the Greek colonies of southern Italy, he was remembered for banishing a plague of flies that was harming the livestock. In Crete, he had rid the island of wild beasts, and in Sicily, he had caught an errant bull and bested the king in a wrestling match. In Spain, Diodorus of Sicily recounts that depending on who you asked, Hercules was credited with either creating the Straits of Gibraltar by tearing the land apart, or with narrowing it to keep out sea monsters. Whereas before that time, a great space had stood between Africa and Europe, he now narrowed the passage in order that by making it shallow and narrow, he might prevent the great sea monsters from passing out of the ocean and into the inner sea. Some authorities, however, say just the opposite, namely that the two continents were originally joined, and that he cut a passage between them, that the ocean was mingled with the sea. On this question, however, it will be possible for every man to think as he may please. In one of the most dramatic episodes of these tales, during his tenth labor, Hercules is tasked with stealing the red cattle of the ogre Geryon, who lived in Arithia in southern Spain, close to the Phoenician colony of Gardiz. Since Geryon lived so far in the west, it was said, the hides of his cattle had been stained red by their close proximity to the setting sun. After killing Geryon, Hercules takes his cattle and herds them all the way back home to Greece in a meandering route that took him from Spain through southern France and over the soaring snowy mountains of the Alps, and on into Italy as Diodorus recounts. Hercules then made his way to Italy. As he traversed the mountain pass through the Alps, he made a highway out of the route which was rough and almost impassable. The barbarians who had inhabited this mountain region had been accustomed to butcher and to plunder such armies as passed through when they came to the difficult portions of the way, but he subdued them all. The story of Hercules bringing these cattle from Spain over these mountains was the dramatic pinnacle of a series of myths that would become known as the Heraclean Way. It was a series of stories that would be told to countless generations of Greek settlers, and then to the children of the Romans who followed them. As the Phoenician hero-god Melkart became increasingly associated with Hercules in later years, these stories would also be told to the children of Carthage. With stories of this wandering hero on their lips, the Greek settlements in eastern Sicily grew. For several centuries, they maintained an uneasy peace with the Carthaginian colonies in the west of the island. But as both powers began to acquire greater amounts of land, they would soon find themselves on a collision course. The exact dating and details of these wars is still fiercely contested, but it's clear that by the late 5th century BC, Sicily had erupted in warfare between Carthage and the Greeks. Soon, it would resemble a piece of meat being torn apart by two hungry dogs. The economy of the island suffered, warlords established themselves as the tyrant rulers of its cities, and banditry and lawlessness spread. For much of these centuries of fighting, the Carthaginians were happy to let the wars with the Greeks simmer on. The citizens of its capital never
went to war, and so long as the peace and comfort of their city was never disturbed, it must have felt to them that these wars were a very long way from home. But the final episode of these conflicts, known as the Seventh Sicilian War, would puncture this sense of invulnerability. That's because Carthage would find itself in a life-or-death struggle with a man who would bring the war home to their shores in dramatic fashion. He was a king of Syracuse, a Greek city-state on the southeastern coast of Sicily, and his name was Agathocles. Agathocles began life as a commoner in the Sicilian colonies, the son of a potter in the port city of Syracuse. At first, he learned his father's trade but soon entered the army and rose through its ranks, until he was able to enact a military coup and seize the throne of the city in the year 317 BC. Agathocles had a high opinion of himself, and as the tyrant of Syracuse, he minted silver coins that portrayed himself as the heir to Alexander the Great, the greatest of all the Greeks. Like Alexander, Agathocles had dreams of conquest. He soon set about subjugating cities all around him, as the historian Diodorus of Sicily recalls. Agathocles began unhampered to subject the cities and strongholds to himself. Mastering many of them quickly, he made his power secure. In fact, he built up for himself a host of allies, ample revenues, and a considerable army. He had picked a mercenary force comprising 10,000 foot soldiers and 3,500 horse. Moreover, he prepared a store of weapons and of missiles of all kinds, since he knew that the Carthaginians would shortly wage war against him. As predicted, it wasn't long before the Carthaginians began to see Agathocles as a serious threat. Carthage amassed a huge army in its usual way, gathering mercenaries and levies from all of its territories and allies, slingers, spearmen, cavalry, elephants, likely speaking a dozen different languages, and sailed all of them to Sicily. On the way, many of their ships were wrecked in a storm, but the force that arrived was still easily enough to overpower the tyrant Agathocles, as Diodorus recounts. As Agathocles saw the forces of the Carthaginians were superior to his own, he surmised that not a few of the strongholds could go over to the Phoenicians, and also those of the cities that were offended with him. After a stinging defeat on the Haimara River in central Sicily, Agathocles retreated east to his port capital of Syracuse, where the Carthaginians surrounded the city and laid siege. For Agathocles, it looks like all hope was lost. But it's here in this desperate moment that he decided on a truly daring course of action. He hatched a plan to break free of the siege by ship, set sail for Africa, and make a desperate strike at the heart of his enemy, the city of Carthage itself. When he saw that all his allies had changed sides and that barbarians were masters of almost all Sicily except Syracuse and were far superior in both land and sea forces, he carried out an undertaking that was unexpected and most reckless. He determined to leave an adequate garrison for the city, to select those of the soldiers who were fit, and with these to cross over into Libya. For he hoped that if he did this, those in Carthage who had been living luxuriously in long continued peace, and were therefore without experience in the dangers of battle, would easily be defeated. When the Carthaginians saw the Greek fleet leaving Syracuse, they believed Agathocles to be fleeing, and they pursued him. They chased the Greeks, harrying them across the sea for hundreds of kilometers, pelting them with arrows and slingstones. But luck was on the side of the Greeks, and Agathocles
Agathocles and his soldiers were able to land on the beaches of Africa. Agathocles must have feared that his soldiers would lose courage and attempt to flee, and so he ordered their ships to be burned in an offering to the gods, as Diodorus recounts. Standing by the stern, he bade the others also to follow his example. Then as all the captains threw in the fire and the flames quickly blazed high, the trumpeters sounded the signal for battle and the army raised the war cry, while all together prayed for a safe return home. This Agathocles did, for it was clear that if the retreat to the ships was cut off, in victory alone would they have hope for safety. Nevertheless, when all the ships were aflame and the fire was spreading widely, terror laid hold upon the Sicilians, as they considered the vastness of the sea that separated them from home. From the city walls of Carthage, the fires of the burning ships would have been visible on the horizon, and now fear was beginning to spread among its citizens. For them, war was something that happened in other places. The city had never been significantly threatened before, and there were virtually no forces there to defend it. Panic and great confusion seized upon the city. The crowds rushed to the marketplace and the Council of Elders consulted what should be done. In fact, there was no army at hand that could take the field against the enemy. The mass of the citizens who had no experience in warfare were already in despair, and the enemy was thought to be near the walls. For the first time, the citizens of Carthage would actually have to fight. They were conscripted en masse, given long spears and shields, perhaps given some rudimentary training, and along with the small complement of city guards, marched out to meet the Greeks in battle. The Carthaginians hoped to make up for the poor quality of their citizen troops with sheer numbers, and vastly outnumbering Agathocles, they were confident of victory. But that was not to be the case. When they met, the experienced and now desperate Greeks smashed the citizen soldiers of Carthage, ran them off the battlefield, and flooded into their camp. And here, Diodorus writes that they made a telling discovery. In the camp of the Carthaginians were found, along with other goods, many wagons in which were being transported, more than 20,000 pairs of manacles. For the Carthaginians, having expected to master the Greeks easily, had passed the word along among themselves to take alive as many possible, and after shackling them, to throw them into slave pens. With this army defeated, the city of Carthage was now completely surrounded by hostile forces, and Diodorus can't help but comment on the ridiculous nature of the situation. In Sicily, the Carthaginians who had defeated Agathocles in a great battle were besieging Syracuse, but in Libya, Agathocles had brought the Carthaginians under siege. It's here that the Carthaginians, in their desperation, seem to have turned to an ancient ritual that forms one of the darkest and most controversial aspects of their history, that is, the rite of child sacrifice. Human sacrifice was, at certain times, a feature of various societies in the ancient world. Rituals of this kind have been attested in several indigenous American societies and in the early histories of Israel and Judah, as well as the cities of Phoenicia like Tyre and Sidon. The Book of Kings records one king of the Levantine kingdom of Moab sacrificing his firstborn child when a war isn't going his way. In Ireland, Britain, and northern Germany during the Iron Age, sacrificial victims were ritually strangled and cast into bogs where the acidic waters mummified them in a state of perfect preservation. This idea of a deadly exchange with the gods seems to be one that recurs in human psychology and has independently arisen in multiple cultures. The idea that if we want to ask the gods for a great favor, we have to give them something truly precious in exchange.
change, and what could be more precious than a human life. With the writing down of the Hebrew Bible and the law codes of Moses, this practice was condemned and outlawed in much of the Levant, and from then on, animals were sacrificed in the place of human victims. In Tyre and other Phoenician cities, the practice also seems to have died out in the first millennium. But there is one place it seems to have continued well into the second century BC, and that is Carthage. These were violent times when human life was cheap, but even so, these rituals were mentioned with some revulsion by several ancient writers, among them the Greek philosopher Plato. With us, for instance, human sacrifice is not legal but unholy, whereas the Carthaginians perform it as a thing they account wholly illegal, and that too when some of them even sacrifice their own sons. At first, these rituals seem to have been an authentic sacrifice, giving up the life of one of your own children in the hope of receiving favor from the gods. But before long, wealthy Carthaginians found a way around this. In fact, they seem to have developed a macabre industry, a trade in other people's children for sacrifice. The writer Plutarch describes this system and gives a sense for the atmosphere of these grisly rituals. Those who had no children would buy little ones from poor people and cut their throats as if they were so many lambs or young birds. Meanwhile, the mother stood by without a tear or moan. But should she utter a single moan or let fall a single tear, she had to forfeit the money, and her child was sacrificed nevertheless. The whole area before the statue was filled with a loud noise of flutes and drums so that the cries of wailing should not reach the ears of the people. For a long time, it was assumed that these stories were exaggerations, pieces of Greek propaganda designed to demonize their enemies in Carthage. But more modern archaeological discoveries have more or less confirmed that child sacrifice did take place, at least at some times and at least by some people in the city. Large collections of buried urns containing the cremated remains of children have been found in large temple sites known as tofets. Some of these temples are exceedingly large, with collections of cremation urns exceeding 2,000 in number. Archaeology has uncovered masks and symbols at these sites, incense burners, and other paraphernalia of ritual, suggesting that the ceremonies were highly structured. It is worth being cautious with these findings. At most of the sites, analysis has shown that the vast majority of these children's remains are of stillborn babies, or babies that had died of natural causes. At a time when child mortality has been estimated at around 30 to 40 percent, the Carthaginians may have considered the tragedy of infant death to be a kind of sacred sign, a human life being taken back by the gods, and the bodies of these children were burned in the tofets as a result. The relative lack of children's remains in the regular graveyards of the city seemed to show that these tofets were at least in part cremation sites for the remains of children who had died of other causes. But analysis of the ages of other remains at other times don't seem to fit with patterns of child mortality. However the ritual had begun, at least in the later years of the city, it had evolved into something much darker and crueler. The inscriptions at these later sites of sacrifice, left over the cremation urns, don't seem to leave much room for interpretation, as this typical example shows. To Lady Tinnit, face of Baal, and Lord Baal-Hamon, the thing that Arish, son of Barashtot, son of Baal-Shelem, maker of strigils, vowed because the lord heard his voice. There are countless of these inscriptions and they all follow this pattern. The child was not offered up front but was promised in advance if the gods came through on their request. The Greek historian
Cleitacus seems to confirm this order of events. The Phoenicians, and above all, the Carthaginians, whenever they were eager for a great thing to succeed, made a vow by one of their children. If they would receive the desired things, they would sacrifice to the gods. A bronze chronos, having been erected by them, stretched out upward hands over a bronze oven to burn the child. The flame of the burning child reached its body until the limbs, having shriveled up and smiling mouth, appeared to be almost laughing. It would slip into the oven. We can't imagine the kinds of things people might have asked for in exchange for these sacrifices. Perhaps in some instances, we can imagine the ritual was performed out of desperation, an extreme measure. Other times, perhaps the wishes were trivial. Good weather on a journey, maybe. Good fortune and wealth in the year to come, or the downfall of a business rival. Whatever their wish was, it seems that if it went on to come true, the child's fate would be sealed. With only fragmentary secondhand accounts and the little that can be gleaned from archaeological sites, we're left guessing about the questions that desperately need answers. How widespread this practice was in society, why and when people engaged in it, and how the majority of Carthaginian citizens felt about it. With the army of Agathocles drawing near and their last citizen defenders defeated in the field, the Carthaginians began to believe that their gods must be angry with them. At least some people in the city believed that it was this practice of sacrificing the children of the poor instead of their own that was to blame, as Diodorus of Sicily recounts. They also alleged that Cronus had turned against them, as in former times they had been accustomed to sacrifice to this god the noblest of their sons. But more recently, secretly buying and nurturing children, they had sent these to the sacrifice. When they had given thought to these things and saw their enemy encamped before their walls, they were filled with superstitious dread, for they believed that they had neglected the honors of the gods that had been established by their fathers. In their zeal to make amends for their omission, they selected 200 of the noblest children and sacrificed them publicly, and others who were under suspicion sacrificed themselves voluntarily in number not less than 300. In this time of peril, the citizens of Carthage reverted to a kind of suicidal religious fundamentalism, but this would not be the end of the city. Agathocles rampaged around the countryside of Carthage for years, but the city's formidable triple-wall defenses would keep him at bay, and soon the Greek king ran out of steam. In his absence, some of his Sicilian vassals were taking the opportunity to declare independence. He hurried back home, leaving his inexperienced son in charge of his army, who was easily outmaneuvered by Carthaginian generals. By the time Agathocles returned to Africa, he saw that the situation had become untenable, and he fled back home to Sicily. But his achievements had been significant. He had left a lasting impression on the people of Carthage, laid waste to their countryside, terrified them so deeply that they had slaughtered their own children, and likely left them on the brink of bankruptcy. A peace treaty in 307 BC essentially returned the situation to exactly how it had been before the war started. The example of Agathocles, of a daring strike at the heart of your enemy right at the moment they least expect it, was an example that later Carthaginian generals would remember and learn from. But it was also an episode that other powers in the region paid particular attention to. Carthage had once been considered the region's major power, but a small Greek army had come within a hair's breadth of bringing it to its knees. The historian Plutarch puts it bluntly in the mouth of one of his characters. For who could keep his hands off Libya or Carthage when that city got within his reach, a city which Agathocles, slipping stealthily out of Syracuse and crossing the
with only a few ships, narrowly mistaking. The first who would seek to take advantage of this perceived weakness was a Greek king named Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus was the king of the Greek kingdom of Epirus, around what is today southern Albania. His name meant fiery or red-haired, coming from the same root as the English word pyre. Plutarch recalls that he seems to have suffered from some kind of developmental disorder that fused together the teeth of his upper jaw, giving him an unsettling look. In the aspect of his countenance, Pyrrhus had more of the terror than of the majesty of kingly power. He had not many teeth, but his upper jaw was one continuous bone on which the usual intervals between the teeth were indicated by slight depressions. Just like Agathocles, Pyrrhus had an immensely high opinion of himself, and fancied himself as the inheritor of the legacy of Alexander. In his later life, he styled himself as a hero of the Hellenic world, the defender of everything Greek. Right at that moment, the Greeks who needed the most defending were the beleaguered colonies in southern Italy, the region known as Megali Halas or Greater Greece. These city-states were suddenly being menaced by a powerful new force in the region, a people from the river plains of central Italy that the Greeks considered to be barbarians, and that had recently emerged as something of a regional superpower. This was the once small and insignificant city-state republic of Rome. Throughout the 4th century BC, this bizarre republic had begun expanding into the hinterlands of its region of Latium and brought a number of other cities under its control. From there, they had managed to upset the power balance of central Italy and toppled a number of well-established rivals, absorbing all of Latium and the region of Campania. Wherever they went, the Romans took a remarkably clever and pragmatic approach to absorbing other peoples into their society. While empires like Carthage kept full citizenship only for the people living in their home city, Rome was far more generous with citizenship. Unlike the armies of Carthage, Rome's legions were made up of citizen-soldiers, and with every free man now a citizen, they were able to draw on vast reserves of manpower. As Rome grew in size and influence, Carthage took notice. About 160 years after the first treaty they had signed, they penned a new expanded agreement with Rome. This new treaty added the condition that Rome would not try to found any cities in Carthaginian territory, suggesting that Roman expansion had become at least a small concern for the region's major power. But for the most part, relations between Rome and Carthage were friendly if suspicious. Carthage welcomed the rise of Rome as a potential ally against their mutual enemies, the Greeks. One district of the city of Rome was known as the Vicus Africus or African Quarter, suggesting that a population of Carthaginian merchants already lived and traded in the city. It seems Carthage viewed Rome not as an unwelcome rival, but as a new potential source of customers. But for the Greek colonies of southern Italy, Rome was a voracious new predator. As Roman power expanded, the Greeks found themselves surrounded, and many of them began sending out letters of distress to the fiery Greek king Pyrrhus. One of these colonies was the city of Tarentum, as Plutarch recalls. The Romans were at war with the people of Tarentum, who being able neither to carry on the war nor put an end to it, wished to make Pyrrhus their leader and summon him to the war, believing him to be a most formidable general.
Pyrrhus couldn't resist this opportunity to position himself as the valiant defender of Greek civilization against these Latin barbarians. He gathered an armada and a large army complete with 20 war elephants, and in the year 280 BC, he sailed to southern Italy in full force. Himself a sophisticated Greek, Pyrrhus expected to meet an unruly barbarian horde on the battlefield. But Roman troops were by now toughened from their long wars of expansion in Italy, and they were already exhibiting the kind of organization that would one day make them famous. When he learned that the Romans were near and laying camped on the further side of the River Cyrus, he rode up to the river to get a view of them. When he observed their discipline, the appointment of their watches, their order, and the general arrangement of their camp, he was amazed and said to the friend that was nearest him, the discipline of these barbarians is not barbarous. But these early Roman legions were still no match for Greek phalanxes, and the sight of Pyrrhus' elephants terrified the Roman horses. Pyrrhus defeated the Romans in two battles, at Heraclea and at Ausculum in the year 279 BC, and he believed that Rome must soon concede the war and agree to the terms of his demands. But slightly to the bemusement of Pyrrhus, Rome simply refused to admit defeat. This refusal to ever sue for peace would become something of a Roman hallmark. Some have argued that Rome's very nature as a citizen democracy actually contributed to their immense doggedness in warfare. Their leaders were politicians and existed in a state of constant competition with each other for the support of the voting public. Any politician who signed a damaging peace treaty could be eviscerated in the senate as a coward, a fool, or even a traitor. This meant that Roman senators would often overwhelmingly vote to continue a war rather than admit defeat. This will to continue, along with their large reserves of citizen manpower, meant that Rome could often absorb terrific defeats, losing whole armies, and simply keep going. This often had the effect of simply grinding down their enemy's will to fight. According to Plutarch, who was fond of inventing dialogue for his historical characters, Pyrrhus made the following quip after his third victory with Rome. We are told that Pyrrhus said to one who was congratulating him on his victory, if we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined, for he had lost great part of the forces with which he came, and all his friends and generals except a few. He had no others whom he could summon from home, and he saw that his allies in Italy were becoming indifferent, while the army of the Romans, as if from a fountain gushing forth indoors, was easily and speedily filled up again. After this series of Pyrrhic victories, Pyrrhus soon realized the conquest of Italy would elude him. He came within miles of Rome, but the tall Servian walls of the city meant that his beleaguered force had no hope of capturing it. Still, he couldn't bear the thought of returning home empty-handed. Pyrrhus decided that he would head to Sicily and see if he could have any more success helping the Greek colonies there fight against the Carthaginians. He arrived in the Greek town of Syracuse to a hero's welcome. Every Greek colony on the island sent troops to fill his army, and Pyrrhus would find the Carthaginian forces on Sicily to be a much softer target than the legions of Rome. The Carthaginian response to Pyrrhus couldn't have been more different to the Romans. With little desire to be dragged back into another war in Sicily, they offered to pay him off generously to leave them alone, but Pyrrhus refused. As Plutarch describes, when the Carthaginians were inclined to come to terms and were willing to pay him money and send him ships, he replied to them, his heart being set on greater things, that there could be no settlement or friendship between.
himself and them unless they abandoned all Sicily. But Sicily, too, eventually defeated him. After years of war, his men were tired. The Carthaginians and Romans were now working together, so he faced the powerful armies of Rome on land and the vast navy of Carthage by sea. After finally meeting with defeat in southern Italy, he cut his losses and sailed for home with little to show for his years of war. As he sailed away, Plutarch imagines Pyrrhus reflecting on the situation he has left behind. He could not master Sicily, which was like a storm-tossed ship, but desired to leave her. It is said that at the time of his departure, Pyrrhus looked back at the island and said to those about him, my friend, what a wrestling ground for Carthaginians and Romans we are leaving behind us. Pyrrhus' campaign had ended in failure. With him gone, Rome quickly swept over the remaining Greek city-states of Italy and solidified its hold on the south of their peninsula. The Romans built roads connecting these wealthy Greek cities to the Roman network, and used the treasure they seized to build a grand series of new temples in the capital, as well as an enormous second aqueduct for Rome, the Aqua Anniovatus. Meanwhile, Carthage reclaimed many of the cities that Pyrrhus had taken in Sicily. But without a common enemy, the twin powers of Carthage and Rome were now butting up against each other. By the year 270 BC, Rome had captured the city of Regium right across the Straits of Messina. They could now look over the water and gaze directly at the coast of Sicily. The wrestling ground that Pyrrhus had left behind in Sicily would set the stage for the next dramatic period of Mediterranean history. It was a stage that would see a conflict unfold, that would dwarf the Sicilian wars for intensity and scale, that would last for a hundred years, that would bring both powers to the brink of bankruptcy, and cost more than a million lives. This was the beginning of the Punic Wars. Punic Wars The word Punic comes from Latin and is a mutation of the Greek word phoenice, or Phoenician. At this time, the Romans had come to use it to describe the Phoenician superpower of Carthage that sat facing them only three days voyage away on the other side of the sea. The historian Cassius Dio summarizes the situation as both the powers of Rome and Carthage slid towards war. The Carthaginians who had long been powerful, and the Romans who were now growing more rapidly stronger, kept viewing each other with jealousy. They were led into war partly by the desire of continually acquiring more, and partly also by fear. It was a chance incident that broke their truce and plunged them into war. The main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War is the historian Polybius, a Greek who was sent to Rome in 167 BC as a hostage. Polybius was writing about the events of the First Punic War a century after they took place, but he was meticulous in his research and traveled widely, gathering as much first-hand knowledge and archival material as he could. As a Greek, he was something of an outsider in Rome, meaning that his portrayal of the war is considered to be relatively even-handed. The story that Polybius tells begins in the volcanic island of Sicily, where, around the beginning of the third century BC, trouble was once again threatening to erupt. At this time, Sicily had something of the Wild West about it. Large parts of it were lawless and fell between the influences of Carthage and the Roman Empire.
Greeks. Both sides often used mercenaries to fight for them, but when a particular war was finished, it wasn't always so easy to get rid of these bands of rough and violent men. One such band were a group of mostly southern Italians who called themselves the Mamertines, or the Sons of Mars, the Roman god of war. In the past, they had been hired by Agathocles to fight Carthage in Sicily, but when the tyrant of Syracuse had died, they found themselves out of work. The Mamertines wandered the island for some time, likely engaging in theft and petty banditry to survive, until they reached the walled Greek town of Messina. Messina was a small settlement on the northeastern tip of Sicily, with the shadow of Mount Etna looming over the horizon, and its location was of great strategic importance. That's because Messina was one side of the narrowest crossing point between Sicily and Italy. Standing on the shore there, you can see the Italian mainland just over the water, and a ship could make the crossing in under 30 minutes. Anyone who controlled Messina would also control this crossing, and this meant that both Carthage and Rome were anxious about the city's future. When the band of Mamertines arrived in Messina, they must have made quite a sorry sight, and the people of the city originally took pity on them. They took them in and even gave them shelter in their own homes. But soon, these hired swords became restless and jealous of the people's comfortable lives. In fact, they began to plot to seize the city for themselves. Polybius recounts what happened next. Certain Campanians serving under Agathocles had long cast covetous eyes on the beauty and prosperity of Messina, and they availed themselves of the first opportunity to capture it by treachery. After being admitted as friends and occupying the city, they first expelled or massacred the citizens, and then took possession of the wives and families of the dispossessed victims. They next divided among themselves the land and all other property. For the next 20 years or so, the Mamertines would run Messina as a kind of pirate fortress. They would use it as a base to conduct raids on nearby towns and villages, and to rob ships that sailed through the narrow straits. But soon, the last remaining Greek king in Sicily, a king of Syracuse named Iero, had had enough. In the year 265 BC, he moved to attack the city of Messina to stamp out these troublesome pirates. Fearing execution for their crimes, the Mamertines played the only card left to them, trading on the strategic importance of the city. They sent out requests for help to both of the big players in the region, to Rome and to Carthage. The Carthaginians, being closer, came to their help first, delighted as always to kick sand in the face of the Greeks. They moved a small army into Messina and helped the Mamertines to defend it. This was just the latest move in the nearly two-century chess game between Carthage and the Greeks of Sicily, but to the Romans, it was a worrying move. With control of the crossing over to Italy, the Romans began to fear that Carthage was plotting an invasion of the mainland, as Polybius recalls. The Romans saw all this and felt that it was absolutely necessary not to let Messina slip or allow the Carthaginians to secure what would be like a bridge to enable them to cross into Italy. The Roman senate was bitterly divided on what to do, with many expressing disgust at coming to the aid of what amounted to a band of pirates. But eventually, their fears won out. They voted to send a force to Messina to secure the crossing, led by a consul named Appius Claudius. Rome was an inland city situated on the river Tiber, and so the Romans were not a naturally sea-going people. With few ships of their own, they borrowed as many as
they could from the coastal cities of southern Italy. When they first took in hand to send troops across to Messina, they not only had no decked vessels but no warships at all, not so much as a single galley, but they borrowed quinqueremes and triemes from Tarentum and Locri and even from Alea and Neapolis. The Romans under the command of Appius successfully made the short crossing in 264 BC, catching the powerful Carthaginian navy off guard. When they arrived in Messina, the Italian mammatines ousted the Carthaginians who had come to their aid and welcomed the Roman army into the town in their place. The Roman capture of Messina immediately shifted the balance of power in Sicily. The Greeks of Syracuse formed a hasty alliance with their ancient enemies in Carthage, overturning two centuries of war to repel this new invader, but it was no good. The Roman commander Appius descended on Syracuse with lightning speed, as Polybius writes. Having succeeded in engaging the enemy, thenceforth he scoured the territory of Syracuse and her allies with impunity, and laid it waste without finding anyone to dispute the possession of the open country with him. Finally, he sat down before Syracuse itself and laid siege to it. King Hiero saw no other way out. He surrendered, switched sides, and swore allegiance to the Romans. This was the end of the last independent Greek states in Italy and Sicily, and the future of the Mediterranean would now be decided by either Carthage or Rome. Both sides now marched to war. In this first Punic War, the Carthaginians were clearly concerned. They drew up a large army of Celts, Iberians, and other peoples, and dispatched it to Sicily. But they were also confident in their overall strategy, which had served them well in previous Sicilian wars. While the warships of Carthage commanded the waves, their trading empire would continue to fill their treasury with gold, and that meant there would always be soldiers ready to fight for them. At first, it seemed the Romans had no hope of changing this situation. They had virtually no navy, and their own shipbuilding technology lagged behind, perhaps by centuries. As the historian Polybius writes, yet so long as the Carthaginians were in undisturbed command of the sea, the balance of success could not incline decisively in their favor. So, they took upon themselves there and then to meet the Carthaginians at sea, on which they had for generations held undisputed supremacy. The Carthaginian navy benefited from a thousand years of Phoenician shipbuilding and sailing tradition, but their centuries of relatively unchallenged dominance of the sea had also made them somewhat complacent. Their method of fighting on the water was based mostly on the use of heavy bronze rams fixed to the front of their ships. The Phoenician sailors relied on outmaneuvering their enemies on the waves with their superior sailing, drawing close with their oars, and crashing into the sides of enemy ships with these rams, striking them in the hulls below the waterline. It was a method of warfare that had remained unchanged for the last 500 years, and the Carthaginians were among the best in the world at this tricky way of fighting. But soon, the Romans would come across a stroke of good luck. After one skirmish on the sea, a Carthaginian galley had run aground on the shores of Italy. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn what made the Carthaginian navy so effective. The Romans rushed to secure the vessel, to haul it away and study its secrets, as Polybius records. The Carthaginians, having put to sea in the strait to attack, a decked vessel of theirs charged so furiously that it ran aground, and falling into the hands of the Romans, served them as a model on which they constructed the
their whole fleet, and if this had not happened, it is clear that they would have been completely hindered from carrying out their design. What the Romans found on this vessel would have intrigued and excited them. At that time, the Carthaginians were legendary, not just for their sailing and the size of their fleet, but also how quickly they could build ships. The writer Pliny the Elder recounts what was possible in those days. Pisa relates that 220 ships were wholly constructed in 45 days. In the Second Punic War too, the fleet was at sea the fortieth day after the axe had been put to the tree. This was long considered to be an exaggeration by ancient writers, but the discovery of the Phoenician shipwreck, known as the Marsala Ship, has thrown light on how this kind of mass manufacture could actually have been possible. When the wreck was discovered, archaeologists found that the ship had each section of its hull marked with certain Phoenician letters. It's thought that these sections would have been built separately, mass-produced in separate factories and then brought together in their final location, with a level of coordination that would not be seen again before the Industrial Revolution. These ships were a kind of ancient flat-pack furniture. Armed with this new knowledge, the Romans began the process of copying the Carthaginian ship exactly, but they didn't do very well. In their first engagement with Carthage, the inferior mobility of these Roman ships and the inexperience of their sailors meant that a squadron of seventeen Roman vessels was destroyed, easily outmaneuvered by the Phoenicians, and dealt death blows by their rams. Following this, the Romans began to change their tactics. Getting the hang of the complicated business of outmaneuvering and ramming enemy ships would take too long, and so they tried to bring the battles at sea into more familiar territory. To do this, they developed an ingenious new technology. It was a kind of boarding bridge that they called a corvus, the Latin word for crow. These were raised like a drawbridge at the front of the ship, and when they drew near to an enemy vessel, these gangplanks would have dropped down onto the enemy deck, where a metal spike on the underside would drive its way into the wood. These bridges would now hold the two ships together, neutralizing the speed and agility of the Carthaginian vessels, preventing them from ramming, and allowing the Roman legionaries to flood on board. It was a crude but surprisingly effective tactic. The Romans kept their new inventions hidden, and now with a secret naval weapon of their own, they risked a large-scale confrontation on the sea. The Carthaginian fleet was busy plundering at a place called Mylae on the coast of northern Sicily when they saw the Roman sails on the horizon. They were delighted that their enemies had finally risked a battle, and were supremely confident of sending the whole fleet of this troublesome Italian power straight to the bottom of the ocean. Polybius recounts what happened next. No sooner did the Carthaginians sight him than with joy they put to sea, with a hundred and thirty sail, feeling supreme contempt for the Roman ignorance of seamanship. Accordingly, they all sailed with their prows directed straight at their enemy. They did not think the engagement worth even the trouble of ranging their ships in any order. When they neared the enemy, they saw the crows raised aloft on the prows of several ships. The Carthaginians were for a time in a state of perplexity, for they were quite strangers to such contrivances as these engines. Feeling however a complete contempt for their opponent, they charged without flinching. But as soon as they came to close quarters, their ships were invariably tightly grappled by these machines. The enemy boarded by means of the crows and engaged them on their decks, and in the end some of the Carthaginians were cut down, while others surrendered in bewildered terror at the battle in which they found themselves engaged, which eventually became exactly like a land fight. Eventually the Carthaginians turned and fled.
fled, bewildered at the novelty of the occurrence, and with a loss of 50 ships. For Carthage, this was an utter disaster. Flying high from their successes, the Romans soon organized invasions of the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, Carthaginian possessions for centuries that had never been seriously threatened. They even organized an invasion of North Africa itself, hoping to follow in the footsteps of Agathocles and march on the capital of Carthage. For the Carthaginians, things were starting to get out of hand. As the Roman invasion force descended upon the coast, Carthage sent out the entirety of its fleet to meet them on the open sea. Polybius recounts that as they sighted the Roman sails on the horizon, the commanders of Carthage spoke to their sailors and soldiers, and vocalized a fear that must have been on the lips of every man and woman in the Phoenician territories, that this war was now in danger of coming home. Meanwhile, the Carthaginian commanders had briefly addressed their men. They pointed out to them that victory in this battle would ensure that the war in the future was confined to the question of the possession of Sicily, while if they were beaten, they would have hereafter to fight for their native land, and for all that they held dear. Polybius records that more than 600 ships came together in the battle that ensued. By the time he was writing his history of the Punic Wars, more than a hundred years later, the size of warships had dramatically increased, and so he likely wildly overestimates the number of men involved, putting it at well over 300,000. Nevertheless, the battle was enormous, and probably involved at least 120,000 sailors, soldiers, rowers, and marines. The vast battlefield would have devolved into a chaos of clashing oars and rams, shouting men and the thud of the corvus bridges crushing down onto the decks, the clashing of shields and swords, the crashing of waves, and the shrieking of gulls overhead. By the end of the day, the result of the battle was a decisive defeat for the Carthaginians. With the fleet of Carthage scattered, the Romans successfully made the crossing into Africa, and landed on the peninsula of Cape Bonn on the other side of the bay from the city. The citizens of Carthage would now have been able to see the campfires of the Roman army in the distance at night. Some of the city's oldest residents would still have remembered when the army of Agathocles had menaced the city only half a century before, when they had watched those ships burning on the shoreline. The Carthaginians had had enough. They asked the Romans for a peace treaty to sign, but the Roman demands were so punishing that the Carthaginians, even in their desperate state, could not accept it, and so the war dragged on. But the Romans, like Agathocles, found themselves unable to take the city of Carthage. The Roman expeditionary force sent to capture the city was beaten disastrously by a smaller Carthaginian army at the Battle of Tunis, and the Roman consul leading it was captured and killed. In this way, the fortunes of each side ticked back and forth like a pendulum. Another naval battle at Cape Hermaeum saw another Roman victory, and another hundred Carthaginian ships sunk. But the Romans had no time to celebrate. On its return voyage home, the victorious Roman fleet was hit by a devastating storm, as Polybius records. The disaster was indeed extreme, for out of their 364 vessels, 80 only remained. The rest were either swamped or driven by the surf upon the rocks and headlands, where they went to pieces and filled all the seaboard with corpses and wreckage. No greater catastrophe is to be found in all history as befalling a fleet at one time. 284 ships were lost, with an estimated 60,000 sailors sinking to the bottom of the sea. It was among the worst naval disasters in history. Some historians have speculated that the Romans' secret weapon, the Corvus boarding bridges, may have actually...
made their ships top-heavy and prone to After this disaster, there are no mentions of the corvus ever being used again on Roman ships. The war would drag on for another 14 years, with most of the fighting taking place in Sicily and the surrounding seas. But by the year 241 BC, Carthage was spent. The Carthaginian senate ordered their general in Sicily to sign whatever peace treaty the Romans demanded, no matter how punishing. This general was a man named Hamilcar Barca. He was proud, a competent general, and he had been winning some of his battles in Sicily. He believed that signing such a punishing treaty was madness, and so he refused the order to negotiate. In his place, the senate sent a more junior commander to capitulate to Rome. The First Punic War ended in the year 241 BC, 23 years after it had begun, with the signing of the Treaty of Lutarchus. It was one of the longest continuous wars to ever take place in the ancient world. It had exhausted both Rome and Carthage, and driven them both to the brink of bankruptcy. But Rome, as the victor, had at least gained something from all the years of carnage. Under the terms of the treaty, Carthage was forced to give up all its remaining territory in Sicily to Rome, and possibly the island of Corsica too. Carthage was forced to release all Roman prisoners without ransom, while hefty ransoms were charged for any Carthaginian held by Rome. They were forced to pay a staggering 82 tons of silver in reparations to Rome over the next 10 years. All of this meant that Carthage could no longer afford to pay its armies. Many of these were foreign mercenaries that it was already in debt to, and in the same year as the treaty was signed, a large band of these mercenaries, around 20,000 men or so, camped outside the city itself, and refused to budge until they got paid. But the state was all but bankrupt. When the Carthaginian senate delayed in paying them, they mutinied and began looting and burning the countryside. While the two decades of war had been tough on the citizens of Carthage, it had been even tougher on the rural regions of Africa it ruled over. Carthaginian provinces like Libya had sent huge numbers of men to fight for Carthage, and they were subjected to punishing taxes to pay for it all. Their resentment had been slowly building, and now it boiled over. When news of this army of rioting mercenaries reached some of these discontented cities, they saw their chance to free themselves of the rule of Carthage entirely. Many of them rebelled, and soon Carthage was engulfed in a civil war. It looked for the first time like the entire empire might come apart at the seams, as Polybius writes. For three years and about four months did the mercenaries maintain a war against the Carthaginians, which far surpassed any that I have heard of for cruelty and inhumanity. The many battles in which they had been engaged at sea had naturally left them ill-supplied with arms, sailors, and vessels. They had no store of provisions ready, and no expectation whatever of external assistance from friends or allies. They were indeed now thoroughly taught the difference between a foreign war carried on beyond the seas and a domestic insurrection. The civil war that followed, which would become known as the Mercenary War, would unfold with unparalleled brutality. The bodies of crucified rebels would have become a regular sight along the roads. The instability caused a famine, and Carthage was forced to raise an army from its citizens, forcing ordinary people in the capital to fight. The man tasked by the Carthaginian senate with carrying out this civil war was the proud general Hamilcar Barca, the man who had refused to
sign the treaty with Rome. Throughout these years of violence, he would have seen his homeland burning, his people starving and dying, and all this time, he nursed his hatred for his Roman enemies. At enormous cost, Hamilcar Barca would eventually crush the rebels, and he sometimes did this quite literally. Many insurgents captured in the later years of the war were executed beneath the feet of Carthage's elephants, the ultimate living symbol of the empire's power. After four years of civil war, some measure of order returned to the scorched countryside. The empire of Carthage had survived, but they were now in an even worse state than before. Meanwhile, the Romans had spent four years recovering and drawing wealth from their new lands in Sicily and Corsica. At Carthage's time of weakness, Rome moved to capture the island of Sardinia too, which had escaped its grasp during the war and was now rebelling against Carthage's weakened rule. The Carthaginians could do nothing to stop them, as Polybius recalls. When the Carthaginians expressed indignation at this, on the ground that the lordship over Sardinia more properly belonged to them, the Romans voted to declare war against them. The Carthaginians, however, having just had an almost miraculous escape from annihilation in the recent civil war, yielded to the necessities of the hour and not only abandoned Sardinia, but they paid the Romans 1,200 talents into the bargain that they might not be obliged to undertake the war for the present. The new balance of power in the Mediterranean was clear. Carthage was now a hollowed-out husk. If they were to reclaim any of the power that they had once held, the next generation of Carthaginian military leaders would need to produce a general of such genius that he could turn around the hopes and fortunes of this floundering empire, a general that would conduct a campaign so daring that it is still studied in military academies to this day. That man would bear a name that in Phoenician meant by the grace of Baal. His name was Hannibal. Hannibal was the son of the general Hamilcar Barca. When the first Punic War ended, he was a boy of only six years old, and he would have watched with the formative mind of a child as the world he knew was torn apart by violence, and his father struggled to end the rebellions. When Rome had snatched away the island of Sardinia, Carthage lost the last of its profitable central Mediterranean islands, and with the empire so weakened, its economy was in freefall. If it was to right itself, Carthage would need to find vast resources of minerals, metals, and people. Hannibal's father knew that the only way these could be found was by expanding Carthage's last remaining overseas territories. These were in southern Spain, as Polybius writes. Hamilcar, with the anger felt by all his compatriots at this last outrage, as soon as he had finally crushed the mutiny of mercenaries and secured the safety of his country, at once threw all his efforts into the conquest of Spain. Hamilcar gathered an army and set out for the Spanish colonies. Rome now ruled the seas, and Carthage's navy was so weakened that he was unable to travel the whole way to Spain by ship. Instead, he had to march all the way across North Africa and ferry his army across the sea at the narrow straits of Gibraltar. When he left, he took his own young son Hannibal with him to teach the boy the art of war and to ensure that he passed on his burning hatred.
hatred for Rome. At the time when his father was about to start with his army on his expedition to Spain, Hannibal, then nine years of age, was standing by the altar while Hamilcar was sacrificing to Zeus. His father took him by the hand, led him up to the altar, and bade him lay his hand on the victim and swear never to be the friend of the Romans. He made his own son Hannibal such an enemy of Rome that none could be more bitter. Despite the weakened state of Carthage, Hamilcar succeeded in conquering the Celtic tribes of Spain. He built a new city there that became known as New Carthage, now the southern Spanish city of Cartagena. While the young boy Hannibal grew up in Spain, he would have likely visited the temple of Melkart, or Hercules in Gardiz, that temple with the golden olive tree at its center. He would have heard stories about Hercules and his legendary journey over the Alps, herding the cattle of Geryon the Giant. Perhaps he would have even learned the history of the Greek Agathocles and his daring strike right at the heart of his stronger enemy. All this while, he would have dreamed of one day making his own mark on history. When his father Hamilcar died and his successor was assassinated, it would soon fall to the young Hannibal to lead the Carthaginian armies in Spain. He continued his father's work of expanding their territories, pushing back the local Celtic tribes who opposed him, and it's clear he developed a flair for warfare. By the time he was 27, Hannibal controlled more than half of the Iberian Peninsula, a vast and wealthy territory of nearly a quarter million square kilometers. From his father, he had inherited an army of 60,000 battle-hardened troops, the best in the empire, and a stable of 200 war elephants. He had also forged alliances with a number of Celtic tribes in Spain that he knew would come to his aid if needed. He was now at the head of the wealthiest and most powerful province of the empire. Hannibal and his father's success in Spain restored the lifeblood of Carthage, and silver once again flowed through the empire. It's said that just one Spanish mine in the region of Bebelo, with its shafts running more than two kilometers into the mountainside, was producing nearly a thousand kilograms of silver each week for Hannibal's treasury. Analysis shows that the coins being minted in Spain at this time were of an exceptionally high content of silver, while those being minted back in Carthage were still watered down with cheaper metals. All of this meant that Hannibal was beginning to feel increasingly confident about testing the bounds of what he could get away with, both with the senate back in Carthage and with his sworn enemy of Rome. The Roman poet Sileus Italicus gives one description of his character. He was one, by nature, eager for action, yet an oath-breaker, cunning beyond all, though of questionable fairness. Armed, he was no respecter of the gods, bold to do wrong, scorning the virtues of peace, and with a thirst for human blood alive in his deepest marrow. Above all, in the flower of his youth, he longed to erase that defeat, a generation's shame, and drown their peace treaty deep in the Sicilian Sea. The location for the flashpoint that would spark the Second Punic War was the town of Saguntum, just north of what is today Valencia in southern Spain. Saguntum was a Roman ally, and Rome had been watching with concern as Carthage's Spanish borders edged ever closer. Rome had made it very clear that they would not tolerate a Carthaginian attack on the city of Saguntum, but Hannibal was willing to call their bluff. In the year 219 BC, at the age of 28, he led his army against the city and put it under siege. The fighting didn't go smoothly.
The people of Saguntum put up a fierce defense from their walls, and Hannibal was even wounded in the thigh by a javelin. But his move to take the city was a clear spit in the eye of the Romans. When they heard about what was happening, Rome dispatched some envoys who turned up at Hannibal's siege camp at Saguntum and demanded to speak with him. He had his men send them away, telling them that he was too busy to talk to them. The Romans must have left seething with rage. Back in Carthage, news of Hannibal's actions were likely met with excitement by his supporters and with a frenzy of dismay by others. One of his great opponents, a man named Hanno, is supposed to have delivered a blistering speech against him in the Carthaginian senate, the words of which the later Roman historian Livy imagines. As long as any single representative of the blood and name of Barca survives, our treaty with Rome will never remain unimperiled. You have sent to the army, as though supplying fuel to fire, a young man who is consumed with a passion for sovereign power, and who recognizes that the only way to it lies in passing his life surrounded by armed legions and perpetually stirring up fresh wars. It is against Carthage that Hannibal is now bringing up his towers. It is Carthage whose walls he is shaking with his battering rams. The ruins of Saguntum will fall on our heads, and the war which has begun with Saguntum will have to be carried on with Rome. But Hannibal also had plenty of supporters, and even his strongest opponents in the senate found themselves in something of a bind. Many would have likely preferred to have Hannibal arrested and his armies given to some more predictable general, but in truth, they had no idea how to do this. Hannibal's soldiers were loyal to him, and any move against him would cause a civil war that could lose Carthage, all of the wealthy Spanish provinces on which their entire economy now rested. But the Romans, too, were paralyzed by indecision. For the eight months of the siege of Saguntum, Rome did nothing but complain. When Hannibal finally took the city, the Romans sent a delegation of ambassadors to Africa to demand an explanation. The clouds of war were once again gathering over the sea. When these men arrived, they spoke before the Carthaginian senate and demanded to know whether Hannibal's capture of Saguntum was the official policy of Carthage or just the work of one rogue general. If he had acted alone, they demanded that Hannibal be arrested and handed over for punishment. If Carthage failed to do that, Rome would declare war. The historian Appian described this moment as the Carthaginian senate made its choice. The Romans now sent ambassadors to Carthage to demand that Hannibal should be delivered up to them as a violator of the treaty. If they would not give him up, war was to be declared forthwith. The chief of the embassy pointed to the fold of his toga and smiling said, Here, Carthaginians, I bring you peace or war. You may take whichever you choose. The latter replied, You may give us whichever you like. When the Romans offered war, they all cried out. We accept it. The poet Sileus Italicus, writing some centuries after the conflict, gives an even more florid rendition. He gestured to them that he carried war and peace in his hands, demanding they choose, and when the senators refused to accept either, he replied, shaking his robes as if pouring out battle and ruin from his arms, take war, unhappy Libya, with an outcome like the first. The Roman historian Livy describes the conflict that ensued in the following terms. The most memorable of all wars ever waged, the war that is which, under the leadership of Hannibal, the Carthaginians waged with the Roman people, for neither have states or nations met in arms possessed of ampler resources, nor was their own might and power ever so great. Growing up among the fires of civil war, Hannibal had learned never to let your heart
homeland become a battlefield. He knew that if he waited in Spain, his lands would soon become host to a Roman invasion force. His fields would burn, his silver mines would dry up, and his people would suffer. So, he decided to take his war to Rome. He withdrew to his capital of New Carthage for the winter to prepare and plan. Here, Livy describes him giving the following speech to his soldiers. You are on the eve of an expedition that will carry you far afield, and it is uncertain when you will see again your homes. With the first signs of spring, with heaven's good help, we may begin a war that shall bring us vast renown and treasure. The journey from New Carthage to Italy was one of about 1500 kilometers, so Hannibal knew that a long and dangerous march awaited him once the spring arrived, and at the end of this journey, a monumental problem loomed ahead of him. That's because the geography of the Italian peninsula made it something of a natural fortress. Beginning in the Cretaceous period around a hundred million years ago, the steady northward movement of the African continental plate, crushing beneath the Eurasian plate in the region of Sicily, had caused the earth's crust to bend and pleat, driving up a dramatic series of mountains that form a sheer wall between the Italian peninsula and Celtic Western Europe, which the Romans called Gaul. These mountains, known as the Alps, can tower up to five kilometers from sea level with permanent snow-capped peaks choked with icy glaciers and with only a few narrow crossing points. The Roman writer Ammianus Marcellinus describes the appearance of the Alps at this time. This country of Gaul, because of its lofty chains of mountains always covered with formidable snows, was formerly all but unknown to the inhabitants of the rest of the globe except where it borders on the coast, and mountain bulwarks enclose it on every side, surrounding it naturally as if by the art of man. The most commonly used roads were the ones that went around this natural wall, the narrow corridor that follows the coastline, past what is now the French port town of Nice. But as the only way into and out of Italy, these roads were heavily defended and lined with ports stacked with Roman legionaries. Here, the Romans could have staged a fearsome defense. Faced with this problem, Hannibal would need a daring solution, and it's here that those stories may have come back to him, stories he must have heard as a child of the great hero Hercules leading his herd of cattle directly over the Alps. The Romans believed that it was impossible to cross the Alps with an army, weighed down with supplies, with horses, oxen, and with a herd of 37 elephants. It would be madness to even attempt it, and for that reason, it was the last thing they would ever have expected. When spring came and the Romans heard of the Carthaginian army beginning its march, they sent ambassadors along the coastal roads and into what they called Transalpine Gaul. There were Celtic tribes of Gauls living on both the Italian and the northern side of the Alps, and so the Romans used the Latin word cis, meaning on this side, and trans, meaning on the other side, to differentiate between them. The Roman ambassadors approached the leaders of these Transalpine Gauls and informed them of the Carthaginian army then making its way towards them. They asked these Gauls to bar the way to Hannibal and his troops, but they didn't get the reception they'd hoped for, as Livy describes. When the envoys, boasting of the renown and valour of the Roman people and the extent of their dominion, requested the Gauls to deny the Phoenician a passage through their lands and cities if he should attempt to carry the war into Italy, it is said that they burst out into such
of laughter that the magistrates and elders could scarce reduce the younger men to order. So stupid and impudent a thing it seemed to propose that the Gauls should bring down the war on their own heads and offer their own fields to be pillaged in place of other men's. This was perhaps the first sign that things weren't going to go as the Romans might have wished. But on his march south, Hannibal did encounter significant resistance from local peoples who didn't welcome the presence of his army. In France, it was only through the excessive distribution of gifts that the Gauls allowed him and his men to pass. The first true obstacle was the River Rhône, one of France's largest rivers. Here, Hannibal's army crossed with difficulty, building rafts to ferry his men and equipment across. But the elephants here posed a significant challenge. These animals were terrified of water, and so to get them across, the Carthaginians built enormous rafts built from whole tree trunks and covered them with earth and turf so that the elephants would believe they were still standing on dry land. In that way, they were able to coax two of the females onto the rafts and across the river, and from there, the rest of the herd were ferried across. Hannibal then followed the River Rhône north and found a tribe of Gauls who agreed to help him achieve his impossible plan, to cross the vast natural barrier of the Alps. These Gauls gave Hannibal and his men supplies and warm clothing for the mountain crossing, but the task ahead was still staggering. By this time, it was October. Winter was closing in, and the passes of the Alps were choked with ice and snow. The later Roman writer Ammianus Marcellinus writes one account of these treacherous Alpine passes. In these Alps, there rises a lofty ridge which scarcely anyone can cross without danger, for as one comes from Gaul, it falls off with sheer incline, terrible to look upon because of overhanging cliffs on either side. Then over precipitous ravines on either side, and chasms rendered treacherous through the accumulation of ice, men and animals descending with hesitating steps slide forward, and wagons as well. In winter, the ground, caked with ice and as if it were polished and therefore slippery, drives men headlong in their gait, and the spreading valleys, made treacherous by ice, sometimes swallow up the traveller. The march to the top of the pass took nine days, and we can only imagine the hardship that these men, their horses and oxen and elephants, all endured during those days. But on the ninth day, they reached the top and now gazed down through the Alpine pass into the green lowlands of Italy stretching out below them. But the descent from the mountains would prove to be even more treacherous than the climb. On their way down, they found that a recent landslide had turned what was already a difficult road into an unpassable precipice. The historian Livy describes the obstacle that faced them. The result was a horrible struggle, the ice affording no foothold in any case, and least of all on a steep slope. When a man tried by hands or knees to get on his feet again, even those useless supports slipped from under him and let him down. There were no stumps or roots anywhere to afford a purchase to either hand or foot. In short, there was nothing for it but to roll and slither on the smooth ice and melting snow. The decision was made to cut a stepped path into this sheer wall, and the episode has become one of the most famous in the mythical retelling of these events that would place over the next centuries. The story goes that Hannibal ordered his men to gather large amounts of wood and build a great fire against the rock of the precipice. As the fire blazed and the flames licked at the icy stone, the rock heated up. Then, the soldiers would pour their rations of sour wine
against the heated rock, causing its and the rock to crack. With iron tools, they then worked away at these fissures, until after four days of labour, steps were cut into the rock, as Livy recounts. After thus heating the crag with fire, they opened a way in it with iron tools, and relieved the steepness of the slope with zigzags of an easy gradient, so that not only the baggage animals but even the elephants could be let down. Four days were consumed at the cliff, and the animals nearly perished of starvation, for the mountain tops are all practically bare, and such grass as does grow is buried under snow. Whether this episode unfolded quite in this manner or not, from the perspective of Hannibal's followers, the purpose of telling this story was clear. Here was a new Hercules, it said, a man who has crossed the Alps with his herd of elephants, a man who achieves great labours wherever he goes, a man for whom the very rock of the mountain presents no obstacle. Climbing down into the foothills, the men must have felt the lowland warmth wash over their skin for the first time, with a sense of enormous relief, as Livy recounts. Lower down, one comes to valleys and sunny slopes and rivulets, and near them woods and places that begin to be fitter for man's habitation. There, the beasts were turned out to graze, and the men, exhausted with toiling at the road, were allowed to rest. But the audacity of Hannibal's plan had come at a cost, as Polybius writes. When Hannibal crossed the Rhone, he had 38,000 infantry and more than 8,000 cavalry. He lost nearly half in the pass, while the survivors, heard by these long-continued sufferings, become almost savage in look and general appearance. Nevertheless, Hannibal and his men now stood and looked out over the lands of Italy below. They had caught the Romans completely by surprise. At the outbreak of war with Carthage, Rome knew that Hannibal's army was on the move. They sent out messengers to find out any word about the location of his forces, but recently, they had been coming back empty-handed. After crossing the River Rhone, the Carthaginian general had disappeared. He wasn't in Gaul, he wasn't in Spain, for the Romans, the situation must have been puzzling and a little concerning. When news came to them of what Hannibal had done, the first note of panic began to set in. Polybius recounts the reaction of one Roman general. Publius had not expected that Hannibal would even attempt the passage of the Alps, or if he did attempt it, that he could escape utter destruction. He was immensely astonished at his courage and adventurous daring when he heard that he had not only got safe a cross, but was actually besieging certain towns in Italy. The Roman government was typically slow-moving and the speed of Hannibal's attack had stunned them. Scarcely had the last rumor about the taking of Saguntum by the Carthaginians ceased to attract attention, then news came that Hannibal had arrived in Italy with his army. What made matters worse was that Hannibal was now recruiting allies from the Cis-Alpine Gauls in the foothills of the Alps, Celtic tribes on the Italian side of the mountains who had fought with the Romans before. The Roman senate went into a panic. They brought up reinforcements from Sicily, from an army that at that moment had been preparing to invade Africa. The general Sempronius Longus led this army of more than 40,000 to intercept Hannibal's forces in northern Italy. They met at the Battle of Trebia in December of the year 218 BC, and here Hannibal's powerful and determined forces utterly smashed the Roman army, killing at least 20,000 soldiers. When news of this defeat reached Rome, the mood in the senate must have been bleak. Hannibal marched south and crossed.
the Apennine Mountains that run down the center of Italy and crush another Roman army on the shore of Lake Trasimene, killing another 15,000 Romans and capturing 10,000 prisoners. From there, his march seemed to be unstoppable. Hannibal would rampage across Italy for a total of 15 years. Chastened by their defeats, the Romans now avoided any battles with him, trying instead to suffocate his army and cut off his supplies. They even resorted to a scorched earth campaign in which they burned their own countryside in a desperate attempt to starve Hannibal's troops. Hannibal's strategy was to march south, hoping that the conquered Greek cities of southern Italy would greet him as a liberator and throw off the rule of their Roman masters. But the journey was hard. On his way, all but the largest of his elephants would die as a result of the harsh Italian winter, and while riding through the marshes of central Italy, Hannibal himself caught an infection that caused the loss of one of his eyes. When he reached southern Italy, he seized a vast supply depot at the town of Cannae, and the Roman senate realized that their strategy of suffocating him wouldn't work. They ordered a vast army to be drawn up, 86,000 soldiers, the largest that had ever been raised in Roman history. With this force, they sent the best and brightest of Roman society to march south to meet Hannibal at Cannae. Hannibal, now frustrated with these months without a battle, was all too eager to accept. Once again, the Roman army was utterly smashed, and the defeat was so total that even high members of Roman society were slaughtered on the battlefield. Livy describes the aftermath. It is said that 45,500 foot and 2,700 horse were slain in an almost equal proportion of citizens and allies. In the number were the quaestors of both consuls and 29 military tribunes, some of consular rank, some of praetorian, and besides these, 80 senators or men who had held offices which would have given them the right to be elected to the senate, but had volunteered to serve as soldiers in the legions. The prisoners taken in this battle are said to have numbered 3,000 foot soldiers and 1,500 horsemen. When news of this staggering defeat reached Rome, the city went into a panic. The people of Rome began seeing evil omens and portents everywhere. One senator was dispatched to Greece to consult the oracle at Delphi, and as the Carthaginians had once done under threat by Agathocles, the Romans resorted to rituals of human sacrifice to appease their angry gods, as Livy describes. By the direction of the books of fate, some unusual sacrifices were offered. Amongst others, a Gaulish man and woman and a Greek man and woman were buried alive in the cattle market, in a place walled in with stone, which even before this time had been defiled with human victims, a sacrifice wholly alien to the Roman spirit. To raise a new army, the Romans reduced the age of boys that were allowed to serve in the military to 17, and began enlisting criminals, those with crushing debts, and even slaves. But their situation looked bleak. After the Battle of Cannae, many of the old Greek cities of southern Italy began to join Hannibal and rebel against Rome. Sicily looked like it could break free, too, and for the next 11 years, war would rage all over southern Italy. In the year 211 BC, Hannibal even marched against Rome itself, causing great panic in the city. But like the Greek king Pyrrhus before him, Hannibal saw no hope of breaching the city's imposing Servian walls. The Carthaginian Senate made several attempts to open up a new front in this war, and capitalize on Hannibal's stunning success. They sent armies into northern Italy and Sicily, hoping to regain
some of their former territories, but none of their other generals had the same ability, and these attempts all ended in defeat. Rome now realized that trying to stop Hannibal was useless, and the only way they could turn the tide of this war was to attack Carthage in return. They sent one army into Spain, led by a general named Publius Cornelius Scipio, who had been among the few survivors of the Battle of Cannae, and he was remarkably successful. In the year 209 BC, in a devastating blow, Scipio managed to capture the Spanish capital of New Carthage. Three years later, he defeated the last remaining Carthaginian army in Spain, essentially seizing the entire province and its abundant silver mines for Rome. Despite everything Hannibal had achieved, the war was starting to turn in Rome's favor. Four years later in 205 BC, with Hannibal still rampaging in Italy, the Romans gave Scipio command of the armies of Sicily and ordered him to set sail for Africa to bring this war to the gates of Carthage itself. After a year of preparation, Scipio set sail in 204 BC. Faced with this invasion that could behead his entire society, Hannibal was forced to take his army and leave Italy to hurry back to Carthage and defend the city, as the Roman poet Sileus Italicus renders it. Carthage, with all her limbs severed, now dependent on a single man. Only the name of Hannibal prevented her great realm from sliding into utter ruin. Envoys promptly set sail, crossing the sea to recall him, with a plea from his country warning that, should he choose to linger, the city of Carthage might exist no more. Hannibal marshaled all the forces of Carthage and met Publius Scipio in North Africa in October of the year 202 BC at a place called Zama. Here on the eve of battle, Scipio and Hannibal finally met for the first time, and Hannibal seems to have presented a dejected, weary face, as Polybius writes. The next day, both commanders advanced from their camps, attended by a few horsemen. Presently, they left these escorts and met in the intervening space by themselves, each accompanied by an interpreter. Hannibal was the first to speak. After the usual salutation, he said that he wished that the Romans had never coveted any possession outside Italy, nor the Carthaginians outside Libya. To this battle, Hannibal brought 80 elephants from the stables of Carthage. But recently, one of Carthage's most important allies, the kingdom of Numidia to their west, had seen the writing on the wall and had switched sides, declaring for Rome. For centuries, Numidia had provided Carthage with its crucial cavalry, and now Carthage found itself facing these same Numidian horsemen on the battlefield. On top of this, the Romans had developed new tactics to neutralize Carthage's great strength, the fearsome war elephants. When the battle began, the elephants of Carthage charged, but the Roman lines opened up to swallow them, containing them with spears and pelting them with javelins. These animals panicked and stampeded back through the Carthaginian lines. In the chaos, the Numidian cavalry now fighting with the Romans swung into the rear of the Carthaginian ranks, and Hannibal's army was driven from the field. He only narrowly escaped with his life. After 17 long years of war, Carthage was once again decisively defeated. After the years of the destruction that Hannibal had wrought in Italy, Rome was in no mood to be lenient.
They forced Carthage to sign an even more crushing peace treaty than the first. All of its overseas territories in Spain and elsewhere were stripped away from it, and many of its lands in North Africa were handed over to the Numidians. Carthage was ordered to pay more than 370 tons of silver, nearly five times the amount they had paid after the First Punic War. The treaty also aimed to destroy Carthage's ability to wage war in the future. It banned them from keeping any war elephants, all of which were handed over to the Romans, and restricted the size of their fleet to only ten ships, barely enough to even protect them from pirates. The rest of the Carthaginian navy was burned in its port. The Roman poet Sileus Italicus describes the scene. Then Carthage witnessed a dreadful sight, her fleet being set ablaze, the waves aglow with the sudden conflagration, while Nereus, lord of the ocean, trembled at the glare. The Carthaginians were restricted from declaring war anywhere outside of Africa, and only in Africa if they got the permission of Rome first. The new political situation was clear. Carthage was now entirely subservient to Rome. Hannibal would live for another 20 years after the Battle of Zama, although he would go into exile in the east, retiring to Tyre, the mother city of Carthage, and then to the Seleucid Empire and Armenia. The writer Pausanias claims that he died when he cut his finger on his drawn sword and developed septicemia from the wound. Other more dramatic stories describe him taking poison when he finds his dwelling place surrounded by soldiers loyal to the Romans come to capture him and take him back to Rome in chains. The Second Punic War was over, and once more, peace returned to that part of the Mediterranean that would last for another 50 years. During this time, despite its diminished situation, Carthage continued to flourish. Ironically, it seemed to do them good to be freed from the responsibilities of defending far-flung colonies and territories that for centuries had drained their treasury. Nothing about the war had changed the city's central role in the network of Mediterranean trade. Money still flowed into it from all corners of the sea, so much so that the Carthaginians offered to pay off the entirety of the reparations they owed to Rome just ten years after the end of the war, when the treaty had given them 50 years to pay it. Some of the largest and grandest buildings in Carthage were constructed during these decades after the Second Punic War. For the people of the city, it must have been a time of renewed hope as the wounds of the long conflict began to heal. But their diminished political situation did have its downsides. Banned from declaring war without Roman permission, Carthage repeatedly found itself defenceless against ambitious rivals in North Africa, and one of these was the new Roman ally and king of Numidia named Massinissa. Massinissa was the king who had betrayed the Carthaginians before the Battle of Zama, sending his powerful Numidian cavalry to fight for the Romans, and possibly tipping the entire battle in their favor. As a result, he had lived a long and prosperous life. He was now at the age of 86, and his long reign had seen Numidia break free of Carthage and become a North African power in its own right, and a loyal ally of Rome.
Masinissa wasn't content with this and he always coveted more land for his growing kingdom. With the power of Rome now backing him and Carthage's hands tied behind its back, he repeatedly moved to seize wealthy pieces of land from the weakened former empire. The Carthaginians, bound by their treaty, had to appeal to the Romans to allow them to defend themselves. But Rome considered Masinissa a crucial ally and they always ruled in his favor. Carthage was like a great stricken whale, slowly being eaten alive by sharks. In the year 152 BC, half a century after the end of the Second Punic War, the Numidian king Masinissa seized a particularly rich tract of farmland that had belonged to Carthage for centuries. The Carthaginians were understandably upset, as the Roman historian Appian writes. Not long afterward, Masinissa raised a dispute about the land known as the big fields and the country belonging to 50 towns which is called Tisca. Again, the Carthaginians had recourse to the Romans. Again, the latter promised to send envoys to arbitrate the matter, but they delayed until it seemed probable that the Carthaginian interests would be utterly ruined. Rome finally agreed to send a delegation to Carthage to mediate this dispute. One of the men sent as part of this delegation was an irascible Roman senator by the name of Cato the Elder. Cato at this time was 81 years old and had spent much of his time in the Senate railing against what he perceived as the increasingly loose morals of Roman society. As a young man, he had fought against the armies of Hannibal in Italy, and as a result, he had grown to utterly detest the Carthaginians and everything they stood for. When he arrived in Carthage, Cato expected to find the city a barbarian backwater, impoverished by its two subsequent defeats at the hands of Rome. But what he found horrified him. Carthage was a booming city that seemed to be doing better than ever, and to his shock, the visible wealth of the city seemed to outdo that of Rome itself. In Plutarch's biography of Cato, he describes the old senator's reaction. The city was by no means in a poor and lowly state, as the Romans supposed, but rather teeming with vigorous fighting men, overflowing with enormous wealth, filled with arms of every sort and with military supplies, and more than a little emboldened by all this. The writer Appian records another version of this moment as the senators rode through the wealthy landscape outside the city. They carefully observed the country. They saw how diligently it was cultivated and what great estates it possessed. They entered the city and saw how greatly it had increased in wealth and population since its overthrow by Scipio not long before. When they returned to Rome, they declared that Carthage was to them an object of apprehension rather than of jealousy, the city being so ill-affected, so near to them, and growing so rapidly. The old senator Cato was shaken by his experience. From then, he would dedicate the final years of his life to a single cause. Now, at every debate in the Senate, Cato would end every one of his statements, whether on the price of grain or the wars in Gaul, whether on the appointment of new consuls, or the response to a flood in the south with a single phrase, Seterum senseo Carthago delenda est. Furthermore, I believe Carthage must be destroyed. Many in the Roman Senate were starting to agree with him. Finally, a year after Cato's visit to Carthage, the Carthaginians had had enough of the Numidian king Massinissa taking advantage of their situation. They sent an army of
50,000 men to seize back some of the farmland that he had taken. But their army was decisively defeated by the Numidians. Carthage's last attempt to defend itself had been a failure, but to the Romans, it was also a breach of their treaty, and it was enough of a pretext to go to war one final time, to destroy their old rival for good. In the year 149 BC, the old Phoenician city of Utica seems to have felt the change in the winds. They also changed allegiances, declaring their loyalty to Rome. In the same year, a large Roman army used the port of Utica to land in North Africa and prepared to march on the city of Carthage. At news of this army landing, the Carthaginians were distraught. They sent envoys to meet the Romans, and when they arrived, the Romans demanded that the city be completely demilitarized and hand over all of their military equipment. The Carthaginians complied. They came back with every piece of armor and weaponry they could find, offering their total surrender. With the Roman general sitting over them on his high seat, they pleaded with the Romans not to go to war. Carthage was now completely disarmed, and in response, the Romans offered them peace on one condition, but it was a condition so absurd that even they must have known it would be rejected. They demanded that the Carthaginians abandoned their city so that it could be demolished in its entirety, and moved 16 kilometers or so inland and away from the sea. Appian recounts these Roman demands. Censorinus rose and with a stern countenance spoke, yield Carthage to us and betake yourselves where you like within your own territory, at a distance of at least 10 miles from the sea, for we are resolved to raise your city to the ground. Such a task would be virtually impossible, and of course, for the seagoing Phoenicians of Carthage, would have essentially ended their livelihoods for good. Moving the city would have meant abandoning their temples, the cemeteries where their ancestors were buried, every street and corner that they knew. Appian records the outpouring of grief as the Carthaginians were informed of the Roman plans. While he was yet speaking, the Carthaginians lifted their hands toward heaven with loud cries and called on the gods. They flung themselves on the ground and beat it with their hands and heads. Some of them even tore their clothes and lacerated their flesh as though they were absolutely bereft of their senses. After the first frenzy was passed, there was great silence and prostration as of men lying dead. So pitiable was this mingling together of public and private grief that it drew tears from the Romans themselves. The Carthaginians withdrew to their city and the entire civilian population prepared to withstand their attackers. The historian Appian summarizes the dire situation that the citizens of Carthage faced. They reflected that their city was without arms, that it was empty of defenders, that it had not a ship, not a catapult, not a javelin, not a sword, nor a sufficient number of fighting men. They had neither mercenaries, nor friends, nor allies, nor time to procure any. Their enemies were in possession of their children, their arms, and their territory. Their city was besieged by foes provided with ships, infantry, cavalry, and engines, while Massinissa, their other enemy, was on their flank. But the city was still a formidable fortress. Its triple line of defensive walls could withstand any assault, and it had complex systems for gathering rainwater and storing it in vast cisterns, allowing it to maintain a continuous supply of fresh drinking water. The Romans settled in for a siege.
but soon found it to be much more difficult than they had expected. They controlled the seas, but swift Carthaginian sailors were still able to smuggle food into the city's harbor at night. The Romans tried again and again to storm the city walls, but each time they were fought back by the citizens, now fighting tooth and nail for their survival with every tool and improvised weapon they could find, as Appian recounts. All the sacred places, the temples and every other unoccupied space were turned into workshops where men and women worked together day and night without pause, taking their food by turns on a fixed schedule. Each day they made a hundred shields, three hundred swords, a thousand missiles for catapults, five hundred darts and javelins, and as many catapults as they could. For strings to bend them, the women cut off their hair for want of other fibers. The siege of Carthage went on for three years. In the year 147, command of the besieging army was given to a new consul, in fact the 36-year-old adopted grandson of the great Publius Scipio, who had beat Hannibal at the Battle of Zama some 50 years earlier, a man named Scipio Aemilianus. With him came his personal friend and official documenter of the expedition, the Greek historian Polybius, who writes this part of his history as an eyewitness. Infuriated at the smugglers still supplying the besieged city, the Roman general Scipio ordered a vast stone barrier to be built in the mouth of Carthage's harbor, blocking any further attempts to resupply it. Food became scarce in the city, but still the defenders struggled on. But in the spring of the year 146 BC, the spirit of the Carthaginians was exhausted. Scipio launched a full-scale assault of the city from the area of the harbor, and the great wars of Carthage were finally breached. The Roman legions poured into the city and began to massacre every person they could find. Appian described the scenes that followed. Then came new scenes of horror. As the fire spread and carried everything down, the soldiers did not wait to destroy the buildings little by little, but all in a heap. So the crashing grew louder, and many corpses fell with the stones into the midst. Others were seen still living, especially old men, women, and young children who had hidden in the inmost nooks of the houses, some of them wounded, some more or less burned, and uttering piteous cries. Still others, thrust out and falling from such a height with the stones, timbers, and fire, were torn asunder in all shapes of horror, crushed and mangled. Trenches were filled with men. The tug of war, the glory of approaching victory, the rush of the soldiery, the orders of the officers, the blast of the trumpets, tribunes and centurions marching their cohorts hither and thither, all together made everybody frantic and heedless of the spectacles under their eyes. The slaughter of Carthage's citizens went on for six days, during which it's thought that an estimated 60,000 people were put to the sword. The Roman general Scipio set his soldiers to work in shifts so that they would not become tired of the killing, and on the seventh day, Scipio ordered his soldiers to begin taking prisoners. From this point, a further 50,000 Carthaginians were rounded up and sold into slavery. From there, they would be sold and dispersed to all corners of the Roman Republic. Carthage was burned to the ground and demolished brick by brick. Some Carthaginians held out for some time in the citadel of Birsa, the fortified hill on which legend has it that Elishaia once cut apart her oxhide at the city's founding. According to Appian, when the Carthaginian general Hasdrupal finally surrendered, his wife set fire to the main temple and climbed upon its roof. Just like the
figure of Elishaia, she then cast herself and her children into the flames. It is said that as the fire was lighted, the wife of Hasdrubal, in full view of Scipio, arrayed in the best attire possible under such circumstances and with her children by her side, said in Scipio's hearing, For you, Roman, the gods have no cause of indignation, since you exercise the right of war. Upon this Hasdrubal, betrayer of his country and her temples, of me and his children, may the gods of Carthage take vengeance, and you be their instrument. Having reproached him thus, she slew her children, flung them into the fire and plunged in after them. Such, they say, was the death of the wife of Hasdrubal. The historian Polybius, who accompanied Scipio throughout the entire siege, writes with little detail about what unfolded. But he does note that in the moment of his victory, the Roman general turned to him and said something strange. In the burning ruins of Carthage, Scipio Aemilianus seems to have felt a spark of apprehension, a sudden fear or realization that one day the same fate might befall his own great city of Rome. Turning round to me at once and grasping my hand, Scipio said, A glorious moment, Polybius, but I have a dread foreboding that someday the same doom will be pronounced on my own country. It would be difficult to mention an utterance more statement-like and more profound. At the moment of our greatest triumph and of disaster to our enemies, to bear in mind at the season of success the mutability of fortune. Appian records that Scipio is said to have wept at the sight of Carthage burning, and that he recited a line from Homer's great epic, The Iliad, in which Andromache, the wife of Hector, laments the coming destruction of Troy. Scipio, beholding this city which had flourished 700 years from its foundation and had ruled over so many lands, islands, and seas, rich with arms and fleets, elephants and money, equal to the mightiest monarchies but far surpassing them in bravery and high spirit, now come to its end in total destruction. Scipio, beholding this spectacle, is said to have shed tears and publicly lamented the fortune of the enemy. After meditating by himself a long time and reflecting on the rise and fall of cities, nations, and empires, as well as of individuals upon the fate of Troy, that once proud city, upon that of the Assyrians, the Medes, and the Persians, greatest of all, and later the splendid Macedonian Empire, either voluntarily or otherwise, the words of the poet escaped his lips. The day shall come in which our sacred Troy and Priam, and the people whom spear-bearing Priam rules, shall perish all. But back in Rome, there was no such sense of foreboding. The city exploded in celebration at the news. When the people of Rome heard of the victory early in the evening, they poured into the streets and spent the whole night congratulating and embracing each other like people just now delivered from some great fear, just now confirmed in their worldwide supremacy, just now assured of the permanence of their own city, and winners of such a victory as never before. They talked about the height of the walls and the size of the stones. They pictured to each other the whole war as though it were just taking place under their own eyes. In the days that followed, ash would have settled over the charred ruins of Carthage. From its final victory in the Punic Wars, Rome would emerge as the only superpower left in the Mediterranean. The scattered Greek kingdoms that remained were one by one absorbed by it, and in the coming centuries, it would grow to encompass the entire shore of that sea, cover all but the farther stretches of Western Europe, and shape the
the entire course of European history. But Carthage would become just a name, a coin that had lost its value, an emblem of an age that had passed into nothing. After the carnage of the siege, the blackened ruins of the city were emptied of all life. But for the Romans, this still wasn't enough. In the years that followed, they sent further delegations to the city to systematically take it apart, piece by piece, to ensure that no population crept back to repopulate its ruins, that never again would their great rival resurface in North Africa. Some of the libraries and archives of Carthage survived the burning of the city. In these were kept the books of Carthaginian history, perhaps poetry and mythology, science and medicine, documents of the Phoenician voyages of discovery to the edges of the world. But all of these were taken by the Romans. Some were simply burned, while others were distributed among the Romans' African allies. As a result, not a single one of these works has survived. Today, scarcely a few documents written by a Carthaginian can be read, and no works of literature or history have come down to us. So, for the next 2,000 years, their story would be told by others. Their voices and their memory, just like their city, were completely erased. The territory of Carthage was absorbed into the new Roman province of Africa, and for the next hundred years, what remained of the ruins of Carthage were left to crumble into the sands, home to wild dogs, overgrown with scrub and weeds and marram grass, washed with salt from the sea air, the roost of gulls and crows. More than a century later, Rome would send a party of 3,000 colonists to the ruins of the shattered city, and they founded a Roman colony on the rubble. As they settled the area, the ruins of Carthage were themselves buried beneath a new Roman town that shared almost nothing of the city that had once stood there except its name, and even the ruins of the city as it had once been would soon be forgotten. Around the year 1835, the British statesman Sir Grenville Temple visited the ruins of Carthage and wrote the following description of his disappointment upon finding how little remained of that once great city. Early on the morning following, I walked to the site of the great Carthage, of that town at the sound of whose name mighty Rome herself had so often trembled. I was prepared to see but few vestiges of its former grandeur, but my heart sunk within me when ascending one of its hills, for I beheld nothing more than a few scattered and shapeless masses of masonry, its very name is now unknown to the present inhabitants. Buried in the silence of the grave, no living soul appearing, except occasionally a soldier going or returning from the fort, or the solitary and motionless figure of an Arab watching his flocks from the summit of the fragment of some former palace or temple. Solitude and silence hold sway over the whole scene, a scene which impresses on the mind a feeling of melancholy which I found difficult to shake off. Another person who visited these ruins was the English poet Letitia Elizabeth Landon, and I'd like to end the episode with her poem entitled Carthage. As you listen, imagine what it would feel like to watch the streets and temples of that city crumble and burn as 800 years of history is buried beneath ash and soot. Imagine every book that has ever been written.
in your native language destroyed, and your people enslaved and scattered about the face of the earth. Imagine what it would feel like to see your own hometown disappear, emptied of all life and demolished brick by brick, then left empty until only a scattering of ruins remains. Lo, it lieth, earth to earth, all to which that earth gave birth, palace, market-street, and fane, dust that never asks in vain, hath reclaimed its own again. Dust, the wide world's king, where are now the glorious hours of a nation's gathered powers? Like the setting of a star in the fathomless afar, time's eternal wing hath around those ruins cast the dark presence of the past. Thou dost build thy home on sand, and the palace-girdled strand fadeth like a dream. Thy great victories only show all is nothingness below.

===== ./corpus/egypt.txt =====
Around the year 1200 AD, the medieval Arab traveler and scholar, Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi, departed from his hometown of Baghdad and set out on a journey of exploration. As a young man, al-Baghdadi had studied law, medicine, and philosophy, and was inspired by the works of classical philosophers, in particular Aristotle. At the turn of the 13th century, al-Baghdadi embarked on a series of journeys that would take him to many of the great cities in the region. He traveled to Mosul, to Jerusalem, Damascus, and Aleppo. Eventually, around the year 1204, his journey took him across the Sinai Desert to the banks of the Nile. On his travels, al-Baghdadi wrote a book that was part travel account and part philosophy, entitled The Book of Edification and Admonition. In it, he recalls the remarkable impression that Egypt made on him. Egypt is a land of wondrous monuments and strange stories. It consists of a valley enclosed by two ranges of hills, one to the east and one to the west. The Nile runs between them until it reaches lower Egypt, where it divides into branches, all of which flow out into the sea. The Nile is unusual for its length. We know of no other river in the inhabited world that covers a greater distance. As al-Baghdadi traveled around Egypt, he was struck by the incredible variety of ancient remains he saw, great temples of stone and tomb complexes crumbling beside the waters of the Nile. But none of these compared to the most fabled of all Egypt's monuments, which rose over the horizon not far from the city of Memphis at a place called Giza. The ancient monuments in Egypt are such as I have never seen nor heard tell of in other lands. First among them are the pyramids. They are very numerous. All are situated on the Giza side of the Nile and extend in the direction of Memphis, spread out along a distance of about two days' journey. Some are big, others small. Some are of clay and mud brick, but most are of stone. Some are stepped, but most of them taper smoothly. And of all these pyramids, three stood out for their seemingly impossible immensity. Turning to the pyramids that everyone talks about, points at, and characterizes in terms of their sheer size, there are three, laid out in a straight line at Giza. Two of them are particularly enormous, and it is with these two that the poets have been infatuated. The spectacle is so awe-inspiring that your sight will falter as you try to take it all in. Al-Baghdadi wrote accounts of the local people who lived close to these vast remains. He describes some who climbed to the tops of these structures, and others who quarried them for their fine-cut stone. Others still became obsessed with exploring the hidden tunnels and chambers that branched out beneath the pyramids. In one of the great pyramids, there is an opening that allows people to gain entry. It leads them into narrow corridors, labyrinthine passageways, well shafts, pitfalls, and other such features as appear in the accounts of those who venture inside and explore the innermost parts. Many people, obsessed by the pyramid and filled with fanciful ideas about it, are inspired to penetrate its depths. But they always end up at some place beyond which they cannot go. They spoke of how the pyramid was full of bats.
and how these bats grow to the size of pigeons. There are inscriptions on the stones, written in the ancient characters that no one understands. In the entire land of Egypt, I have never found a single person who so much as claimed to have heard of anyone who knew how to read them. He even seems to have visited the Sphinx nearby, which was then buried up to its neck in the sands. Also, by the three pyramids, at a distance from them of rather more than a bow shot, the likeness of a most enormous head and neck protrudes from the ground. The people call it Old Father Dread, and assert that its body is buried in the ground. The face is handsomely, indeed admirably portrayed, with a touch of elegance and beauty about the features, as if a smile were playing across them. Above all, Al-Baghdadi was impressed by the mastery of engineering. It must have required to build such constructions, and to have them survive for such a stretch of time. The construction of the pyramids was carried out, according to a methodology remarkable in respect both to design and to precision of execution. This is what has enabled the pyramids to endure time's passing eras. Or rather, it has meant that time itself has had to endure the era of the pyramids. Noble intellects gave the pyramids their all. Pure minds exhausted their every effort for their sake. Enlightened souls outpoured their loftiest capabilities on their design, to stand as exemplars that are the pinnacle of the possible. Because of this, they all but speak aloud of their builders, telling us what sort of folk they were, giving voice to their intellects, relating the stories of their lives and times. When Al-Baghdadi visited Giza around the year 1200, the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world, and had been for more than 3,700 years. All that time, it had testified to the greatness of the civilization that had grown up on the banks of the Nile, a civilization that had passed through countless periods of flourishing and decay, and then finally disappeared beneath the sands of the desert. The Great Pyramid The Fall of Civilizations My name's Paul Cooper, and you're listening to The Fall of Civilizations podcast. Each episode, I look at a civilization of the past that rose to glory and then collapsed into the ashes of history. I want to ask what did they have in common, what led to their fall, and what did it feel like to be a person alive at the time, who witnessed the end of their world? In this episode, I want to tell the story of one of the most iconic cultures ever produced by humankind, the civilizations of Egypt's Nile Valley. I want to show how this series of related societies grew up in the floodplains of their great river, and built some of the most enduring and recognizable structures in the world. I want to tell the story of how they rose, how they endured, and how they finally faded from history altogether. The Story of Egypt The story of Egypt is one of the greatest and longest epics in all of history. Many empires would consider themselves lucky to last through the reigns of 31 kings, but ancient Egypt would see the reign of 31 dynasties of kings, lasting for more than 3,000 years. In the time since, historians have long struggled with this panoply of rulers and eras, and have tried to wrestle the history of Egypt into neat categories.
degrees. They typically split its history into three sets of dynasties, commonly known as the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. Between these are a number of intermediate periods, when the central power of its kings failed and the land divided. Throughout this history, Egypt's empire would ebb and flow just like the great river that gave it life. That river was the greatest water course of the entire Afro-Eurasian landmass, the River Nile. The Nile finds its source in Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa. It's a body of water about the size of the US state of Georgia, or nearly the size of Ireland. The gigantic Lake Victoria drains into the river known as the White Nile, which is joined by the so-called Blue Nile further downstream at Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. From there, it flows for a further 2,000 kilometers across the Nubian and Egyptian deserts to Cairo, where it branches out into a wide delta and empties into the Mediterranean Sea. Next to the Amazon River, the Nile is either the longest or second-longest river on earth. It runs for 6,800 kilometers, or around a sixth of the way around the earth, and its drainage basin covers a tenth of the entire landmass of Africa. Egypt itself has an extremely arid climate, and its inland territories experience virtually no rainfall. If geography had been only a little different, and Lake Victoria had not begun to drain westwards, we can only imagine how differently history might have gone. For at least the last 5,000 years, every blade of grass and every tree in the Nile Valley, every animal and every person to ever live, every priest and every king, owes their existence solely to this river. Human presence in Egypt is among the oldest in the world. After evolving in the region of East Africa, modern humans migrated primarily along this corridor, and from there spread to the rest of the world. The Nile is in a sense the highway down which all of humanity has once passed. As one of our first stops along our great journey, Egypt is home to human remains of astonishing antiquity. Stone tools worked by archaic humans have been discovered in Nile deposits dating to as early as 600,000 years ago, and modern Homo sapiens followed in the last 100,000 years or so. These migrations likely happened during one of the many African humid periods that have occurred over the last millions of years. These are times when shifts in the planet's climate caused rains to fall on the Sahara Desert. During these periods, the desert bloomed into a verdant grassland, home to animals and people, and when the period ended, the grasses would die, the animals would leave, and the sands would return. It's thought that this cycle has occurred more than 200 times since the desert first formed 8 million years ago. The earliest peoples in this region lived by hunting and fishing, and left behind stone tools and a multitude of rock paintings. From about the year 13,000 BC, in one of the Sahara's driest periods in history, the Sibyllian culture began gathering wild wheat and barley, and from there developed their own domesticated strains. From 9,000 BC, people began to weave thread from wool, and another humid period began. One enigmatic stone circle at the desert site of Nabta Playa dates to around 7,500 BC, when the Sahara was a range of rolling grasslands once more. This stone monument may have been used to mark the movements of stars at different times of the year, so that
that people could keep track of cycles like the harvest and the migration of animals for hunting. Nabta Playa has been called Egypt's Stonehenge, but this doesn't quite do it justice, since it was built at least 5,000 years before the first stones of Stonehenge were ever laid. When the last ice age ended and the Sahara once more dried up, any peoples who had been living and herding in its grasslands would have been driven out of their ancestral home. They would have wandered across the newly formed desert until they reached the only stretch of green in the midst of all that sand. That was the banks of the Nile, and here they would make their home. These peoples would build a collection of scattered settlements reaching up and down the river. But slowly, as more and more people were driven to the riverbank to survive, these began to coalesce into larger towns, cities, and finally, kingdoms. The ancient Egyptians referred to the whole region by the name The Two Lands, referring to the long Nile valley in the south and the delta that spread out in the north, close to the sea. These were the two lands that today we call Upper Nile. Surprisingly for a modern person who orients their maps facing north, the Egyptians thought of their world in the opposite direction. As a consequence, their word for east was the same as their word for left, and west the same as right. In the Egyptian mind, they were always facing upstream, waiting for the annual floods to arrive. If you find this confusing as we continue, just remember that southern Upper Egypt is the region upstream, and northern Lower Egypt is downstream. For many people at this time, the lands along the riverbank would have constituted their entire world. The Egyptians referred to the river's floodplain as Kemet, or the Black Land, due to the rich, dark soil left behind by its life-giving floods. This land was the realm of the noble god Horus, who had the head of a falcon, the god of life, protection, and healing. If you walked just an hour in either direction, you would soon reach what they called Deshret, or the Red Land. This was the inhospitable desert stretching out on all sides, roasting hot, largely devoid of water and shade, and inhospitable to most life. These deserts were presided over by the god Set, the god of chaos and violence. The Nile itself, they knew simply by the name Eteru, or the river, since in their world, there was no other. The Egyptian world began in Upper Egypt, far up the reaches of the Nile, at a place now known as Aswan. Here, a belt of hard granite crosses the landscape and forces the river waters into shallow whitewater rapids, running over boulders and through rocky channels called cataracts. This word comes from the Greek word cataractes, or rushing down. Today, the waters of these cataracts have been tamed by the construction of the Aswan Dam, but in ancient times, they could be a rushing torrent. Each year when the floodwaters passed through this rocky stretch of the river, they made such a thundering sound that the earth itself could shake, and this led the ancient Egyptians to believe that the waters were coming up from beneath the earth, bursting out of vast subterranean seas. At Aswan, they built a temple on an island in the middle of those rushing waters, and here worshipped that primeval force. The fast-flowing waters at Aswan made it a natural barrier to ships, and prevented any further exploration upriver. For this reason, for much of its early history, this was
where ancient Egyptian influence ended, the final extent of their power and border of their empire. Beyond Aswan was the southern lands of Nubia, and for this reason, Egyptians would also refer to it as the narrow gateway to the south. The temple island in the Aswan Cataracts was known to the Egyptians as Abu, the Egyptian word for elephant, since it was a hub for the ivory trade with these southern lands. The Greeks would follow this example and named the place Elephantine. From here, trade caravans would pass over land south to the Darfur region of Sudan, bringing gold, ivory, and other goods. But north of Aswan, everything was considered to be Egypt, as Herodotus records. All the land watered by the Nile in its course was Egypt, and all who lived lower down than the city Elephantine and drank the river's water were Egyptians. Such was the oracle given to them. Luckily for the Egyptians, the Nile flows from the south to the north, while the prevailing winds blow in the other direction, meaning that you could use the winds to sail against the current as far as Aswan without too much effort. But the return journey would be even easier, allowing the river waters to simply carry you along. A ship heading downstream to the north from Aswan would see for some time only rocky desert and the river bordered by cliffs of hard Nubian sandstone. This is not a land well suited to agriculture, but in ancient times, these valleys were sources of natural resources like gemstones, copper, and gold. Further north, the red cliffs fall away and the floodplain around the river gets wider. Here, the landscape would have blushed green and a larger population could be supported. It was in this region that the desert city of Thebes would grow up, which the Egyptians called Waset. This would one day become the most powerful city in Upper Egypt, the capital of the desert regions. The living part of an Egyptian city, its houses and markets and workshops, tended to be built on the eastern bank of the river where the sun rises, while the western bank where the sun set was used only for burials and tombs. Sailing further north, you would reach the area we call Middle Egypt and the floodplain gets wider still. This region would have been full of wildlife and vegetation. Some way to the west of the river, the waters divert and fill a large oasis known as Fayoum, which sprouts like a broad leaf from the stem of the Nile. In ancient times, this lake was home to large populations of Nile crocodile, so that the settlement on the shore would be known by the Greeks as Crocodilopolis or Crocodile City. Here, Egyptians apparently even tamed crocodiles in their temples, as Herodotus recounts. Now for some of the Egyptians, the crocodiles are sacred animals. Those who dwelt about Thebes and about the lake of Moyris hold them to be most sacred, and each of these two peoples keep one crocodile selected which has been trained to tameness, and they put hanging ornaments of stone and of gold into the ears of these and anklets round the front feet, and they give them food appointed and victims of sacrifices and treat them as well as possible. In other places, crocodiles were hunted for food using ingenious but risky methods. A man puts the back of a pig upon a hook as bait and lets it go into the middle of the river, while he himself upon the bank of the river has a young live pig which he beats, and the crocodile hearing its cries makes for the direction of the sound, and when he is drawn out to land, first of all, the hunter plasters up his eyes with mud, and having done so, he very easily gets the mastery of him, but if he does not do so, he has much trouble.
Also living in the river were the animals that the Greeks would call river horses, or hippopotamus, our hippopotamus. The river horse is sacred in districts of Papremes, but for the other Egyptians it is not sacred, and this is the appearance which he presents. He is four-footed, cloven hoofed like an ox, flat-nosed with a mane like a horse, and showing teeth like tusks, with a tail and voice like a horse, and in size as large as the largest ox, and his hide is so exceedingly thick that when it has been dried, shafts of javelins are made of it. The most strategically important location was what the Egyptians called the balance of the two lands. This was the place where the river split into its delta. As the crossroads between Upper and Lower Egypt, this was always the natural place for the capital when the empire was united. This location would give rise to the city of Memphis, and in turn, to modern Cairo. It is here that the Egyptians would build their most famous and lasting monuments. Each year, the monsoon rains falling in the highlands of Ethiopia and Central Africa would swell the river, and the annual flood would arrive. This happened with such regularity around the middle of August that the Egyptians timed it using the rising of the star Sirius. In the 5th century BC, Herodotus wrote the following description of these floods. When the Nile is in flood, it overflows in places as far as two days' journey from either bank. The Nile comes with a rising flood for a hundred days from the summer solstice, and when this tale of days is complete, it sinks again with a diminishing stream, so that the river is low for the whole winter till the summer solstice again. The Egyptian year was divided into three seasons, the flood season of Akhet, the growing season of Peret, and the harvest season of Shemu. Once the floodwaters receded in early autumn, the land was refreshed and fertilized with rich Nile mud, and new crops could be grown. In this black mud, farmers grew emmer wheat, barley, beans, and lentils throughout the cooler winter season. When summer came again, the grain was ready to be harvested. Egyptian life was held in this delicate balance. Each year, if the river flooded too little or too much, the results could be devastating, as one ancient Egyptian hymn to the Nile makes clear. If he is greedy, the whole land suffers. Great and small fall moaning. People are changed at his coming. When he rises, then the land is in joy. Then every belly is glad. Every jaw has held laughter. Since their lives depended so greatly on these floods, the Egyptians developed ingenious systems for measuring them. At the cataracts of Aswan, they built a series of devices known as Nileometers. These often take the form of towers with deep wells inside that allow the river to flow in with measurements inscribed on their walls in Egyptian cubits. Each year, ancient people would anxiously check these Nileometers to see how high the water was rising that year, and whether it would be a time of famine, a time of plenty, or a time when they would need to hastily build some flood defenses. During the period known as the Pre-Dynastic Era, the two halves of Egypt were divided, and this division was cultural as well as political. The desert people of southern Upper Egypt worshipped their own god, Nehbet, who was commonly depicted as a griffon.
vulture, a powerful and majestic bird. These people were likely darker-skinned and had more of a cultural and linguistic connection with the southern lands of Nubia and sub-Saharan Africa, their rulers sometimes even intermarrying with the royalty of southern kingdoms. Meanwhile, the people of northern Lower Egypt paid deference to the god Wadjet, usually shown as an Egyptian cobra. They had more genetic influence from North Africa and the Mediterranean and may have been somewhat lighter-skinned. The kings of southern Upper Egypt ruled while wearing a white bulbous crown, while the kings of the north wore a red crown with a spiraling representation of a cobra emanating from it. The kingdoms that ruled over these regions were always fluid, but the geographical distinction between Upper and Lower Egypt always held sway. But around the year 3,000 BC, or more than 5,000 years ago, all that began to change. That was because of a king of a kingdom called Finis. His name was Namer. The figure of Namer is wreathed in mystery, and what little we know about him has been pieced together from fragments of inscriptions and a few significant artifacts. Namer was born under the personal name Menes, but chose Namer as his Horus name, or king name, when he came to the throne of Finis. This name perhaps gives us some sense of his personality. That's because Namer means something like fighting catfish. The Nile catfish that the king clearly admired is a remarkable species. It's a predatory fish, a nocturnal hunter that can grow up to 1.2 meters long, or about the size of a dolphin, and uses a form of naturally generated electricity as a weapon. Using a unique organ in its body, it can generate an electric shock of up to 350 volts that stuns its prey. In the largest catfish, this shock can be enough to stun an adult human, and the Egyptians were fascinated by this unique property. They depicted these shock and awe predators on painted wall murals, and even experimented with using the weak electric charges of young specimens as a treatment for arthritis. We might imagine that this king Namer wanted to emulate some of the characteristics of these surprise hunters, but whether it was their patience lying in wait for their enemies, the tenacity of their surprise attacks, or the shock and awe with which they stunned their prey, we may never know. Virtually the only source we have for this period is a carving known as the Namer palette, which contains only a handful of cryptic clues. One side of this carved artifact shows King Namer standing over a defeated enemy, gripping him by the hair in one hand and raising a mace in the other. It's a clear sign of domination. Here, Namer is shown wearing the white bulbous crown of his native Upper Egypt, suggesting that he bludgeoned his rivals there into submission. On the other side, the carving shows the king leading an army, while ranks of his defeated enemies lie before him. Below this, an image of a bull is shown tearing down the walls of a fortress with its horns. On this side of the carving, Namer is wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt. From this, we might assume that he set out on a campaign of conquest and successfully brought the two lands of Egypt together. Two mythical animals carved on one side of the Namer palette stand with their long necks intertwined, perhaps representing the coming together of the two sides of Egypt, their lives and their fates now inextricably bound. This was a union that would see the newly united Egypt grow to become one of the most influential societies in early human history. At first, Egyptian culture was heavily influenced by the slightly older civilisation.
civilizations of Mesopotamia, like the Sumerians. Egyptian palaces were often built to a Sumerian design and they used Sumerian motifs in their art too. But by at least the year 3000 BC, Egypt had matured its own indigenous artistic culture and its own system of writing. The Greeks would later refer to these by a word which means sacred carving or hieroglyph. The Egyptian hieroglyphs are a mixed writing system that uses a variety of phonetic symbols as well as a collection of symbols that represent whole words. For example, an image of a man holding up his hand to his mouth could be used to represent the common word eat, but other symbols that represented groups of consonants could be used to spell out other less common words, names, or places. Hieroglyphs emerged a little after the invention of cuneiform in Mesopotamia and it's possible they were inspired by this older writing system. In Mesopotamia, we can see the gradual evolution of the cuneiform writing system from its earliest symbolic roots, but in Egypt, the earliest discovered example of hieroglyphs show the symbols springing into existence already fully formed in a complex system. This suggests that they may have been developed all at once as a conscious effort and were perhaps even devised by a single person. The Egyptian hieroglyph for ruler was the shepherd's crook, since the king was considered to be a kind of shepherd for his people. Egyptian kings would even symbolize their royalty by holding a gilded, curved crook modeled after those used by shepherds. These kings have come to be known as Pharaohs. The word Pharaoh derives from the Egyptian word per-a-a, meaning great house, and it has stuck in the popular imagination as the name used for any Egyptian ruler, partly due to its use in the Bible. But there is actually no evidence that it was used to refer to Egypt's rulers until nearly 2,000 years after Naamer's lifetime. Up until that time, throughout the first 18 dynasties of Egypt's history, its rulers were simply referred to as kings or neswet, and by epithets such as his majesty. Still, the term Pharaoh has gained such currency and popular usage that it's still used to refer to all the rulers of Egypt across the ages. The Pharaoh in ancient Egypt was considered the living embodiment of the falcon god Horus and the son of the sun god Ra. One later hymn praises the figure of the king. Pharaoh is the lord of wisdom whose mother knows not his name. Pharaoh's glory is in the sky. His might is in the horizon. Pharaoh is the bull of the sky who shatters all at will, who lives on the being of every god. Perhaps most famously of all, the Egyptians were compelled by their religious beliefs to embalm the bodies of the dead, ritually cleansing them in preparation for the afterlife. The Greek Herodotus, who traveled widely in Egypt, wrote about the specialist embalmers who would prepare bodies in this way in exchange for a fee. They, whenever a corpse is conveyed to them, show to those who brought it wooden models of corpses made like reality by painting, and demonstrate on these the best of the ways of embalming. The second which they show is less good and also less expensive, and the third is the least expensive of all. Having told them about this, they inquire in which way they desire the corpse of their friend to be prepared. With the price negotiated, the embalmer could begin their work, the grisly process of which Herodotus also describes. First, with the crooked iron tool, they draw out the brain through the nostrils, extracting it partly thus and partly by pouring in drugs, and after this with a sharp stone of Ethiopia, they make a cut along the side and take out the whole contents of the belly, and when they have cleared out the cavity and cleansed it,
with palm wine, they cleanse it again with spices pounded up. Then they fill the belly with pure myrrh, and with cassia and other spices, and sew it together again. Having done so, they keep covered up in natron for seventy days. And then they wash the corpse and roll its whole body up in fine linen cut into bands, smearing those beneath with gum, which the Egyptians used generally instead of glue. Mummification was expensive and only those with wealth could afford it, rich merchants, royal officials, and of course, the pharaoh himself. A one inscription on the walls of a tomb for the pharaoh Unas gives a sense of the kinds of prayers and blessings that might have been spoken while these rituals took place. This one to the sun god Amun-Ra and the moon god Thoth. Sun and Thoth, take Unas with you, that he may eat of what you eat of, that he may drink of what you drink of, that he may sit where you sit, that he may sail in what you sail in. The booth of Unas is plaited of reeds. The flood of Unas is in the marsh of offerings. His feast is among you, gods. The water of Unas is wine like the sun. Unas will circumnavigate the sky like the sun. Unas shall course the sky. Upon coming to the throne of the newly united Egypt, King Namer built a new capital, perfectly placed at the balance of the two lands where the river met the delta. This city would become known as Enebu Hedge, or the City of White Walls, but today we know it as Memphis. The kings who followed Namer would rule from this new capital, but they spent much of their time traveling between palaces, and when they died, their bodies were still taken back to Namer's home region of Thinis in Upper Egypt to be mummified and buried in the city's ancestral burial ground at Abydos. That was until the reign of a king named Hotep Saqemwi. He ruled from about 2900 BC and started what has been called the Second Dynasty of Egypt, and he took the decision to start a new burial ground near Memphis so that Egypt's pharaohs could be buried close to their new capital. For the site of this new burial ground, he chose a place on the western bank of the river, the side where the sun sets, at a vast open place called Saqqara. Saqqara is situated on a raised plateau that the floodwaters of the Nile do not reach. Visually, it would have been striking to ancient people as the place where the green river lands end and the dead sand of the desert abruptly begins. For this reason, it may have been considered a crossing place between death and life, the perfect place for a necropolis or a city of the dead. For kings who wanted their tombs to be remembered, it also had the benefit of being highly visible from the new capital of Memphis. Over the coming centuries, this site would become full of tombs of kings and queens, and countless royal attendants and nobles who followed them into the afterlife. At first, these tombs were built in a form known as a mastaba, large rectangular constructions built of mud brick and promising their inhabitants a rebirth into the next life. These could be very large, but they were still relatively unassuming. But soon, Egyptian pharaohs would get even more ambitious with their burial arrangements. This ambition truly began with the rule of a pharaoh named Nebjeriket Djoser.
The reign of Djoser begins the period known as the Old Kingdom, which would last for the next 500 years. Djoser was the son of a king named Khas Akemwi, who had reunited Egypt after a period of turmoil, during which the northern delta rose in rebellion. With order now restored, Djoser clearly wanted to keep it that way. Rather than continuing to travel around the country as pharaohs before him had done, he moved to a permanent capital at Memphis, where he could keep a better eye on the restive northern riverlands. Over his nearly three decades of rule, he set about an ambitious program of construction, rebuilding temples and throwing up fortresses all along the river. But it was in the manner of his burial that he would truly leave his mark. When Djoser began the construction of his final resting place, it looked a lot like the Mastaba tombs of the kings that had come before. But his royal architect soon began dreaming of a more ambitious structure. He was a visionary chancellor and engineer who held numerous official titles in the kingdom, including head of the royal shipyard, royal seal-bearer, and overseer of all stone works. His name was Imhotep. Imhotep's name means the one who comes in peace, and he was born in the 27th century BC. But beyond that, much of what we know about him has been distorted by myth and legend. He was something of a polymath, a priest, a statesman, a scribe, physician, and architect, and even gained fame as a magician. He also has the distinction of being perhaps the first non-royal person to be recorded in any detail by history. As the king's most trusted architect, Imhotep was put in charge of the construction of Djoser's tomb, but it would not be a regular mud-brick Mastaba like his predecessors. In fact, Imhotep was determined to build this tomb out of stone. This stone would need to be quarried from the bedrock nearby, roughly cut into blocks. But as this stone Mastaba rose out of the desert, Imhotep seems to have had an idea. With this stronger building material, the structure could support more weight, and so, there was no real reason to stop building. Once the first Mastaba was built, he experimented with placing another smaller one on top of it, and then another on top of that, creating a stepped design like a wedding cake. Originally, Imhotep planned to build this construction four tiers high, but soon, he became even more daring. By the time it was finished, Djoser's tomb stood six layers high. It was perhaps the world's first large-scale construction made from cut stone, and rising to a height of 62 meters, it was likely also the tallest building on earth. Finally, the stepped pyramid of Djoser was complete, and when the king died, he was laid to rest in a granite chamber beneath the great edifice, surrounded by a maze of tunnels. Djoser's pyramid was a revolutionary step in Egyptian architecture, and it would stand as a challenge to all the kings who would follow him, a challenge that they would find irresistible. The difficulties that engineers like Imhotep faced in building these pyramids were enormous, but their achievement becomes even more impressive when you consider that these monuments also had to be built fast. Today, Egypt is littered with the remains of half-built pyramids. These were abandoned halfway through their construction, usually because the Pharaoh who commissioned them had died early. Once a Pharaoh was dead, it seemed no one saw any point in continuing to build his tomb. After all, there was a new Pharaoh now, and construction on his pyramid would have to begin right away. For this reason, pyramids usually had to be completed at the very least within 30 years.
Only the kings with the longest and most stable reigns would ever live to see the final capstone placed. The next pharaoh after Djoser was a man named Sekhemket, who may have been Djoser's brother, and he would join the ranks of the Unfinished. As soon as he came to the throne, he began the construction of stepped pyramid of immense ambition, sure to dwarf his brother's achievement. But only the first layer of the pyramid was built when Sekhemket died just six or seven years into his reign, and the pyramid was abandoned. Another king, Khabar, also died after six years before his stepped pyramid could be completed. To build each pyramid, the Egyptians would require enormous amounts of laborers, as many as a hundred thousand per pyramid, with about ten thousand laboring at any one time. There's a widespread misconception that these monuments were built by armies of slaves, but most historians now believe this not to be true. Slavery was an aspect of Egyptian society as it was across the ancient world, and slaves were mostly taken from prisoners of war and also from those who fell into debt or committed serious crimes. But slaves were mostly used as domestic servants, or if they were unlucky, toiled in extraction industries like mining and quarrying. These were considered an underclass and would not have been trusted with construction of such important and sacred buildings. In fact, evidence shows that the pyramid builders were a mixture of professional artisans and laboring peasants who worked seasonally in exchange for rations. The life of an Egyptian farmer was dictated by the coming and going of the annual floods, and there were only a few times of year when they could be meaningfully employed in the fields. For the rest of the time, they would have leased out their services to construction projects, the digging of canals and other public works, and the construction of pyramids. While they labored for the king, these workers drank beer three times a day and ate meat regularly. They toiled in three-month shifts and were divided into teams of 20 men. The discovery of their graffiti hidden on the inward-facing sides of some stone blocks in the pyramids shows that they gave themselves playful and boisterous team names, some of which have been recorded. The friends of Khufu, the vigorous Gheg, the followers of the powerful White Crown of Khufu, those who know the Pharaoh, the drunkards of Menkori. It seems their supervisors fostered a sense of team pride and healthy competition, perhaps giving honors and extra beer rations for those who shifted the most blocks. Doubtless, the work was backbreaking, but over the following millennium, millions of Egyptians would take this deal. Perhaps they also felt a sense of pride at the great constructions they were taking part in, which if all went well, they would live to see completed. These laborers were sufficiently respected that any who died during the construction were buried in tombs within the royal complex, their bodies forever a part of the monolith they had given their lives to build, an honor that would never have been given to a slave. The vast administrative effort of building these tombs over the next centuries required a fundamental restructuring of Egyptian government. In the past, most of the high positions of state had been doled out to the Pharaoh's family, but with such ambitious projects to be completed, skilled people would be needed. In the decades that followed, individual functions of government, such as the master of scribes and controller of workshops, were separated out and these roles were delegated to capable individuals who were promoted on merit. The Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson summarizes the transformation in the following terms. As Egypt embarked on pyramid building, the pyramids were building Egypt. This new cast of civil servants took pride in their work. One Egyptian text of the Fifth Dynasty records the advice that a vizier
named Ptahhotep gave to his son about how to be a successful administrator. Let not your heart be puffed up because of your knowledge. Be not confident because you are a wise man. Take counsel with the ignorant as well as the wise. Good speech is more hidden than the emerald, but it may be found even among maidservants at the grindstone. Still, the failures of the kings that followed Djoser must have left a mark on the Empire's morale. Their crumbling, half-finished pyramids stood in the desert as an image of kingship that could also be fragile and fleeting. With his stepped pyramid, Djoser had laid down a provocation that would have to be answered. But it wasn't until the reign of a king named Snefru that someone would rise to the challenge. Snefru's full name was Horneb Ma'at Snefru Waj. Horus lord of Ma'at has perfected me. Ma'at in Egyptian religious belief was the embodiment of justice and truth, sometimes portrayed as a goddess wearing an ostrich feather on her head who kept the stars and the seasons in their regular patterns and maintained peace. Opposed to her in their theology was the concept of isfet, chaos, darkness, and disorder. This was sometimes depicted as a great coiling serpent. For the most part, Snefru's name seems to have been appropriate. Under the protection of Ma'at, he reigned for as long as 48 years, a time of prosperity and stability. His accession to the throne is remembered in the later Egyptian source, the Prisa Papyrus. The majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Huni, came to the landing place of death, and the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Snefru, was raised up as a beneficent king in this entire land. During his half century on the throne, Snefru would secure his place as Egypt's most ardent and determined pyramid builder. With the failure of the last kings to build a stepped pyramid to match Djoser's, Snefru began to wonder if he could build something even better, a pyramid that conformed to a perfect geometrical shape. He had a vision of a pyramid with polished, smooth sides, unlike anything the world had seen before. His first attempt to accomplish this would be at the Pyramid of Meydoum. There is some debate about whether the Meydoum pyramid was built by Snefru or by his predecessor Huni, but we can assume they wouldn't compete for the honor as it stands as one of the most impressive failed pyramids in history. The Meydoum pyramid was built in several stages. First, it was a stepped pyramid of similar design to Djoser's, and then this interior structure was encased in a steep shell of white limestone, creating a high and narrow point. The effect would have been beautiful, that is, until one day as the pyramid neared completion, when the entire weight of the stone facing began to collapse in all directions. We can only imagine the noise and calamity that must have accompanied this, the workers leaping clear of the wreckage, the overseers watching aghast as an avalanche of painstakingly cut stone poured off the side of the pyramid. The moment this happened, Snefru ordered the construction to be halted. Workmen inside the interior chambers simply put down their tools and left. Today, the burial chamber inside the pyramid is still unfinished, with raw, uncarved walls and wooden supports still in place which were usually removed after construction. Snefru must have been devastated, but he wasn't discouraged.
Soon, he tried again with a pyramid at the site of Dahshur, just to the south of the royal necropolis of Saqqara. This pyramid was intended to be tall, and its sides were even steeper than the first. His workmen began to construct it with a sharp 53-degree slope to its sides, and this time Sneferu must have hoped that he would get the pyramid he dreamed of. But this would not turn out to be the case. This second pyramid was built on ground that was only soft sand and shale. As the pyramid took shape and its weight climbed into the millions of tons, they found that the stone was sinking into the earth and causing cracks to appear in the structure. We can only imagine how it felt to be the architect who had to bring this bad news to the king, the son of Ra, the living embodiment of the god Horus. The workmen tried everything they could, from adding new supporting blocks to the base, to propping up subsiding sections with huge beams of cedar wood, but it was hopeless. It became clear that if they continued the pyramid as planned, it would likely collapse, just as the first one had. The pharaoh Sneferu seems to have listened to reason. He consented to allow his workmen to hurriedly finish the pyramid with a reduced angle of only 43 degrees, and a final height reduced by 25 meters. This means that today, the pyramid has a peculiar snub-nosed appearance that has given it the name the Bent Pyramid. It's clear that Sneferu still wasn't satisfied. He now ordered the construction of a final pyramid one kilometer to the north, combining everything his craftsmen had learned from the first two. This one was now built with a 43-degree incline from the beginning, more evenly distributing the weight on the earth, and finally, Sneferu got the pyramid he desired. This was the first structure that truly took the iconic shape of an Egyptian pyramid and would be used as a model for those that would be built in years to come. It was 105 meters high, nearly twice the height of Djoser's pyramid and the world's new tallest building, and its geometrical perfection was undeniable. When Sneferu died, he was buried in this pyramid according to his wishes, and his son took the throne. He would be the greatest pyramid builder of all. His name was Khufu. As a boy, Khufu must have seen his father, Sneferu, obsessed with the construction of his three pyramids. We can imagine the young prince listening in on his father's conversations with his architects, the tension and anger as the first two pyramids failed, and then the final triumph of the Red Pyramid, and perhaps as a boy, he dreamed of one day building such a monument for himself. We know very little about Khufu or what his reign was like, but it's clear that he was inspired by one thing, size, and above all, the desire to build the largest pyramid that would ever stand. Learning from his father's mistakes on the Bent Pyramid, and likely inheriting some of his architects, Khufu elected to build his tomb some 15 kilometers to the northwest of Saqqara, on a shelf of strong limestone just outside Memphis, at a place called Giza. When construction began on the Great Pyramid, there must have been some uncertainty about whether it would even be possible. It was built using an estimated 2.3 million large stone blocks, weighing a total of 6 million tons, and when its first layer was completed, it was the size of more than ten football pitches. Its builders used predominantly local limestone quarried from nearby on the Giza Plateau to build the pyramid's interior structure, and these were bound together
with lime mortar packed with straw and charcoal. Luckily, these organic remains in the pyramid mortar can be carbon dated, allowing archaeologists to date the pyramids with scientific certainty to this period. But while rough stone would do for the main body, the king's burial chamber at its heart was made of blocks of hard granite brought from Aswan since it needed to resist the crushing weight of millions of tons of stone above it. The fine limestone blocks of its outer shell were quarried at a place called Tura on the other side of the river. The stone from these quarries was of exceptional quality, a pale white in color, almost like marble. For this reason, it was highly prized for use on the interiors of tombs and the perfect casing for a pyramid. This limestone was cut out of underground tunnels in these quarries and dragged down to the banks of the Nile, where it was loaded onto barges to be carried downstream. In order to ease the transportation of these stones, the Egyptians dug a series of canals and artificial harbors that came right up to the base of the pyramids, one of which was known as She-Kufu, or the Pool of Kufu. One papyrus has been uncovered, the oldest ever found, that is the work journal of an overseer named Merer. In it, he records the process of this perhaps less than exhilarating task. Day 25. Inspector Merer spends the day hauling stones in Tura south, spends the night at Tura. Day 26. Inspector Merer casts off from Tura loaded with stone, spends the night at the Pool of Kufu. Day 27. Satsail loaded with stone, spends the night at the pyramid. Day 28. Casts off from the pyramid in the morning, sails up river to Tura south. Day 29. Inspector Merer spends the day hauling stones in Tura south, spends the night at Tura. Day 30. Inspector Merer spends the day hauling stones in Tura south, spends the night at Tura. Remarkably, the pyramid was oriented perfectly to true north, with one of its faces at each point of the compass, suggesting that the Egyptians must have used measurements of the stars in order to align it, the only method by which they could have achieved such accuracy. With the kingdom's now-exceptional organization, it's been estimated that it took only about 23 years to build, with the final stones being placed around 2560 BC. Upon its completion, the Great Pyramid of Giza would stand 147 meters high, or nearly 40 stories. It was the tallest man-made structure in the world and would remain so for nearly 4,000 years. The building that eventually surpassed it, the wooden spire of Lincoln Cathedral in England, completed in 1311, would stand for little more than two centuries before it collapsed in a storm. Today, Khufu has cemented his name into history with the construction of these monuments. But other than his ambitious pyramid, little else is known about him. The only representation of him ever found is a single statuette carved from ivory. Ironically for a man so obsessed with grand scale, this statue is only seven centimeters, or less than three inches, tall. When Khufu died around 2525 BC, his son Jadephre would take the throne. But his reign was short and when he died, another of Khufu's sons became pharaoh. His name was Khafre. The pharaoh Khafre would follow in his father's and grandfather's footsteps and build a grand pyramid of his own. He would place it right beside his father's, but for some reason, he declined to build it any higher. It could be that his builders, perhaps tiring of this mania for ever bigger and better pyramids, simply told him that it wouldn't be possible.
to build any bigger. It may be that Khafre worried that it would have appeared unseemly to one-up his dead father quite so ostentatiously. Perhaps for this reason, Khafre's pyramid would be a deferential three and a half meters shorter than his father's, although he was sure to place it on a slightly higher shelf of limestone, meaning that from many angles it appears taller. Coupled with slightly steeper angled sides, this meant Khafre was also able to build his pyramid with perhaps 350,000 fewer stone blocks, a saving that his teams of laborers and stonemasons no doubt appreciated. Today, the pyramid of Khafre is the only pyramid at Giza to retain any of its original casing stones of smooth white Torah limestone which still cling to the top third of the structure, perhaps since its steeper sides made it more difficult for stone thieves to extract the very top of its masonry. This allows us to picture how these monuments would have looked in their golden age, the smooth white sides that must have gleamed blindingly in the desert sun, and at night, shone in the light of the moon. These pyramids were also likely capped with a stone known as a pyramidion, usually carved of diorite or granite and carved with hieroglyphs. Some examples of these pyramidions have been found with distinctive grooves that suggest that they were encased in a decorative metal, either copper or shining electrum, an alloy of gold and silver. Since the pyramidions for the Giza pyramids have never been found, it's unknown whether their tops were encased in metal. But if they were, it would have made them an even more impressive sight, a gleaming pinnacle reaching up to the heavens. Within only a hundred years or so of the construction of Djoser's first stepped pyramid, all of Egypt's largest pyramids had already been built, all by only three generations of the same family. But almost from the moment the final capstone was placed on Khafre's massive monument, enthusiasm for enormous pyramids began to wane. The pharaoh Menkaure, the son of Khafre and grandson of Khufu, also built his pyramid at Giza around 2510 BC, but his would be significantly smaller. It's not even a tenth the size of the Great Pyramid and only two-thirds the size of even Djoser's stepped pyramid. One explanation for this was that Menkaure didn't expect to live long enough to build such a grand construction as his predecessors. Herodotus records one piece of tradition about the pharaoh Menkaure which recounts how an oracle told him that his reign would be short. As a result, he determined to make the best of the time he had, and perhaps this left him little time for pyramid building. The king deemed this unjust and sent back to the oracle a message of reproach, blaming the god. Why must he die so soon, whereas his father and his uncle had lived long? He caused many lamps to be made and would light these at nightfall and drink and make merry. By day or night, he never ceased from reveling, roaming to the marsh country and the groves, and whenever he heard of the likeliest places of pleasure. Whether there's any truth to this or not, it's clear Menkaure had different priorities to Khufu and Khafre, and his more modest pyramid seems to have broken the spell of his family's one-upmanship. For the next thousand years, pharaohs would continue to build pyramid tombs, but they would be mostly at a much reduced scale and they would cut bigger and bigger corners in their construction. Instead of a solid limestone structure, these later monuments would often be a simple limestone shell encasing a core of mud brick or simply earth and sand. For this reason, little remains of these later pyramids, other than melancholy heaps, alone in the desert. Slowly, the practice would begin to die out altogether.
The reason Egyptians stopped building pyramids was partly due to changes in religious attitudes towards burial, but it also seems to have stemmed from concern over tomb robbers. After all, a pyramid was essentially an enormous sign announcing to the world that the richest man in Egypt was buried there. From the earliest days, people were drawn to the tombs of long-dead kings to attempt to steal their treasures. One tomb inscription of a royal architect named Inenni gives us a clue about these changing priorities. He writes that he constructed his king's tomb not in an ostentatious declaration of power, but in total secrecy. I supervised the excavation of the cliff tomb of his majesty alone, no one seeing, no one hearing. Even with these secret tombs, grave robbers were still a constant concern. One pharaoh of the later New Kingdom would order an inspection of his predecessor's tombs, and his inspectors brought back troubling news. The tomb of the king, it was found that the evildoers have damaged it by forcing an opening into the main chamber of his tomb through the passage wall of the Sanctuary of Nebemen, superintendent of the grain stores of the king. In the funerary place, the body of the king had been removed and the tomb of his royal spouse, the royal lady of Nubshas, was empty. The robbers had laid violent hands on them. It wasn't just the precious treasures inside that were stolen. As the overseer Merer had found, cutting the limestone blocks from the quarries of Tura was one of the most time-consuming parts of construction. For this reason, pharaohs who felt more pressed for time sometimes despoiled previous pyramids of their cut stone in order to speed along their own monuments. One Middle Kingdom text known as the Instruction of Merikare advises kings against this shameful practice. Do not despoil the monument of another, but quarry stone in Tura. Do not build your tomb out of ruins, using what has been made for what is to be made. In place of constructing their own pyramids at Saqqara or Giza, the later pharaohs would be buried at a place near Thebes that the Egyptians called the great and majestic necropolis of the millions of years of the pharaoh, or sometimes the Great Field. But today, it is known as the Valley of the Kings. Here, a natural rock formation known as El Khurn or the Horn, rises above a series of dramatic red cliffs. When viewed from the entrance to the tombs here, this pointed peak somewhat resembles a natural pyramid. It's possible that this convenient landform may have relieved some of the pressure on Egypt's pharaohs and allowed them an equally prestigious place to be buried, while freeing up an untold amount of energy and manpower in the kingdom. Egypt's manual laborers could perhaps breathe a sigh of relief. Slowly, the age of the pyramids came to an end. Still, that was a long time in the future, and throughout the fourth and fifth dynasties of Egypt, royal monument construction continued confidently. But in the sixth dynasty, around the 23rd century BC, construction began to decline. Part of the reason for this was an increasing decentralization of the empire and a gradual weakening of the power of the king. The final pharaoh of the old kingdom was named Pepi II. He came to the throne at the age of six and ruled for more than 60 years. Pepi was an excitable and enthusiastic child, as we can see from one tomb inscription by one of his officials named Harkuf. Harkuf had a long and illustrious career. He served as the mayor of one of Egypt's southern provinces in the region of the Nile Cataract of Aswan, the narrow gate to the south.
The highlight of his life was the four journeys of exploration he undertook on behalf of his pharaoh following the Nile down into the heart of Central Africa, into what the Egyptians called the Horizon Lands. He wrote a full account of one of these expeditions on the walls of his tomb. I accomplished it in seven months. I brought back from there all sorts of beautiful, exotic produce and was praised for it very greatly. I came back with 300 donkeys laden with incense, ebony, precious oil, grain, leopard skins and elephant tusks. The boy pharaoh Pepi was so delighted with Harkuf's trip that he wrote a letter directly to him. The letter was likely written on fragile papyrus and has not survived. But luckily, Harkuf was so proud of this sign of royal favor that he had the letter copied out word for word on the wall of his tomb, his proudest moment etched into stone for eternity. In it, we get a sense for the voice of this excitable young king. You know how to do what your lord loves and favors. You wake and you sleep planning to do what your lord loves, favors, and commands, unique friend Harkuf. Pepi was especially excited by a small man that Harkuf had come across in East Africa and had brought back with him, perhaps either a man with dwarfism or a member of the so-called pygmy tribes of Central Africa. You have further said in this message that you have brought a dwarf of the god's dancers from the land of the horizon dwellers. Come downstream to the residence at once, hurry, and bring with you this dwarf that you have brought, alive, prosperous and healthy, for the king. When he goes down with you into the boat, have excellent people around him on deck lest he fall in the water. My majesty wishes to see this particular dwarf more than the produce of the lands. However, as a pharaoh, Pepi was relatively ineffectual. During his childhood, his mother and grand viziers seemed to have done much of the ruling, and as an adult, he continued a relatively hands-off approach to the kingdom. For much of its history, Egypt had been governed by regional administrators known as nomarchs who were appointed by the pharaoh to rule over their regions on his behalf. Pepi's long reign saw an increasing amount of power passing to these regional governors. Gradually, their positions became hereditary rather than appointed, so that single families began to amass large amounts of power, and their tombs became larger and more elaborate with every passing year. These nomarchs were soon beginning to look a lot like feudal lords, or even petty kings, and even began fighting amongst themselves. Meanwhile, the once boy king Pepi was now entering his 70s, frail and increasingly detached from the business of ruling. This might not have been a death blow for the kingdom, but it was around this time that a record drought descended over Egypt and the entire eastern Mediterranean, starting around the year 2200 BC. This climate shift we have encountered before, it is known as the 4.2-kiloyear event and has been implicated in the collapse of the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia, and perhaps even the Indus Valley Civilization in India and Pakistan. In Egypt, the result of this event was a series of years in which the Nile floods were much reduced and agriculture came under immense pressure. The drought was so severe and long-lasting that the verdant lake at Fayyum, that once stood 65 meters deep, completely dried up over the next 50 years, and crop yields would have plummeted. The long reign of a pharaoh was usually good news for the kingdom. It tended to generate a period of stability and often prosperity, but when a king's rule went on too long, it had the tendency to create what we might call the old king problem. The long reign of the pharaoh Pepi
along with his multiple wives, meant that he had countless children, many of them now old men themselves, with children and grandchildren of their own. They were all impatient to see this old king pass on so that they would get their chance to rule. When Pepi finally died around 2175 BC, what followed was a succession crisis of immense proportions. The chaos serpent of Isfet now wound its way around all the lands of Egypt. In the two decades that followed, the kingdom would see no fewer than 17 pharaohs come and go, some perhaps dying of old age and others no doubt killed by their rivals. The only one of these kings to survive more than a year on the throne was a man named Ibi, who even somewhat optimistically tried his hand at building a pyramid at the royal burial ground of Saqqara. But this monument was a testament to the now much-reduced state of the empire. Standing at little more than 30 meters high, it was smaller than the pyramids of some of the earlier king's wives. On top of that, it was lazily constructed around a core of mud and limestone chips. King Ibi, the man who was to be buried under this sad monument, ruled for only two years, one month and a day, and likely did not control all of Egypt. Now, local nomarch governors declared independence and ruled their provinces alone. Their tombs around this time stop referring to the reign of a pharaoh and are full of boasts and elaborate titles that they seem to have invented for themselves. One tomb inscription for a powerful nomarch named Aktifi demonstrates how the centralized power of the king was declining. I am the vanguard of the men, the rear guard of the men, a leader of the land through active conduct, strong in speech collected in thought. For I am without peer who spoke out when people were silent, on the day of fear, when Upper Egypt was silent. Aktifi recalls the time of famine that swept over the land as crisis after crisis rocked the struggling old kingdom. All of Upper Egypt was dying of hunger to such a degree that everyone had come to eating his children, but I managed that no one died of hunger in this province. The entire country had become like a starved grasshopper, with people going to the north and to the south in search of grain. Egypt was now fracturing into something like the shape it had been before King Namer had fused it into a stable, centralized state nearly 800 years before. Refugees were flooding the roads. Another later Egyptian writer called Ipuwer, who lived in the period following this chaos, describes people resorting to theft to survive and violence spreading. The guardians of the house say, let us go and steal. The snares of birds have formed themselves into armed bands. The peasants of the delta have provided themselves with shields. A man regards his son as his enemy. The wrongdoer is in every place. The inundation of the Nile comes, yet no one goes out to plow. Ipuwer describes a widespread economic collapse during which trade from foreign lands dried up. The skilled masons who built pyramids now labor on farms, and those who tended the boat of the gods are yoked together in plowing. Men do not go on voyages today. What shall we do for cedar wood for our mummies, in coffins of which priests are buried, and with the oil of which men are embalmed? They come no longer. Everything is in ruins. Laughter is dead. If I only knew where God was, I would make offerings to him. Throughout this period of about 200 years,
Some, at least, must have dreamed of a better time awaiting them in the future. Another text written after this time, known as the Prophecy of Neferti, contains a prediction that a ruler would come who would end this time of strife. A king will come. He will take the white crown. He will wear the red crown. He will unite the two mighty lands. Rejoice ye people of his time. The Asiatics will fall to his sword, and the Libyans will fall to his flame. The rebels belong to his wrath, and the treacherous in heart belong to the awe of him. The man who would fulfill this prophecy, or rather, the man in whose reign the prophecy was more likely written, would reunite Egypt and usher in a new age of stability. His name was Nebepetre Mentuhotep II. Mentuhotep was a king in the city of Thebes in Upper Egypt. Sitting on the eastern bank of the Nile, about 800 kilometers from the Mediterranean, Thebes is one of the sunniest and driest cities in the world. It had been the capital of its own province throughout the Old Kingdom, but had always been something of a backwater, and somewhat influenced by the African culture of Nubia. But during the more than a century of chaos that surrounded the collapse of the Old Kingdom, Thebes slowly grew to become the capital of the south, and its kings began referring to themselves as the Great Overlord of Upper Egypt. It was a city where tightly packed rows of houses, granaries, and workshops clustered around the central temple to the god Amun, and its people clearly sought a break from the suffocating influence of the kings in Memphis. But in the north, near the traditional center of Egyptian power, an ambitious and ruthless rival was also amassing its forces. This was centered around the city of Henen-Nesut in Lower Egypt, in the verdant region between the River Nile and the Great Lake at Fayoum, a region that the desert Thebans dismissively called the Marshlands. This city would later be known as Heracleopolis, or the City of Hercules. For about a hundred years during this time of dissolution, Thebes and Henen-Nesut had fought bitter wars over small border regions, forts, and roads, but neither side could ever gain the upper hand. That was until the reign of the King of Thebes, Mentuhotep. He was named after the Theban god of war and came from a line of warlike kings. He clearly desired to bring this series of conflicts to a decisive conclusion and reunite the fractured kingdom of old. The final confrontation between north and south would be sparked by a rebellion in the city of Thinnes, once home to King Namer and which was now one of the vassals of Thebes. Delighted by this development, the northern power of Henen-Nesut seized the opportunity and marched south into the desert to capture the town. War soon raged across all Egypt. At one point, the northerners pushed south and captured the ancient sacred city of Abydos, and there unleashed a wave of destruction against its temples and palaces. One later text, known as the Instruction to Merikare, purports to be written by a king of northern Henen-Nesut who is racked with guilt for the destruction of this sacred city. Lo, a shameful deed occurred in my time. The province of These was ravaged. Though it happened through my doing, I learned it after it was done. There was retribution for what I had done, for it is evil to destroy. Beware of it. A blow is rebounding.
paid by its like. To every action, there is a response. This response would come in the form of a thundering reprisal by the king of Thebes, Mentuhotep. He would march into the north and defeat the armies of Henen-Nesut. Next, he rounded on the northern capital, when he captured it, all of the funerary monuments of its kings were defaced and destroyed, perhaps suggesting a sacking of the city. Whatever the northerners had done to the sacred center of Abydos, it was clearly visited upon them and their city tenfold. Mentuhotep now swept through northern Egypt and the provincial governors saw the writing on the wall and swore fealty to him. After nearly two centuries of dissolution, the two halves of Egypt were once again united. The period that followed, known as the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, would last for around 300 years. But it has not left an impressive archaeological record. Compared to the towering pyramids of the Old Kingdom and the architectural magnificence of the later New Kingdom, it stands out as something of a dull time for grand monument construction. But it did experience a flourishing in another area, that is, in the realm of Egyptian literature. One famous story written around this time is called the Tale of Sinuhe. It narrates the life of a man who traveled north into Palestine and beyond, but who eventually becomes homesick and decides to return to Egypt. Another collection of stories was written around this time, a kind of ancient Arabian knights known as the Tales of Wonder. It relates a number of fantastical stories, imagining that they were told to the great pharaoh Khufu of the Old Kingdom by his three sons. Another story written during the Middle Kingdom is known as the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor, a kind of ancient gulliver's travels. It is remarkable for its innovative structure, a tale within a tale about a sailor shipwrecked in the Mediterranean who finds himself on an island ruled by a gigantic serpent. A storm came up with us on the open sea and no chance for us to reach harbor. The wind grew sharp and made a constant moaning and there were hungry 14 foot high waves. A piece of wood of some sort hit me and then the ship was dead. Of all those fine men, not a one survived. Then, I was carried to a desert island by a swell of the great green sea. The man speaks with the great serpent who tells him a sad story of his own, that his whole family was killed when a star fell to earth. The serpent tells the man not to fear, that a ship will eventually pass by the island and rescue him, and reassures him that he will soon have a great story to tell. Now, you are going to spend one month and then another until you finish four months on this island. Then, a ship will come from Egypt with sailors in it whom you know that you may go with them toward home and die in your own city. What joy for one who lives to tell the things he has been through when the suffering is over. Finally, the predicted ship arrives and the man is rescued.
the ship arrived just as he had foretold. I climbed a lofty tree and recognized the sailors in the ship and went running to report it. Then I descended to the shore near where the ship was. I hailed the crew and offered thanks beside the sea to the Lord of the Isle, and those on board did likewise. We have examples of myths and legends written before this time and religious texts, but this is not the story of some bygone king or the actions of the gods. It's a story about an ordinary man in a fantastical situation, told seemingly just for the entertainment value of telling a story, and for that reason, it is possibly the first true piece of literature. It was likely written around the year 1900 BC and is therefore nearly 4,000 years old. The lives of Egypt's pharaohs take up so much of the usual discussion of its history, partly because they are the ones who commissioned the inscriptions, the monuments, and the statues. But as the Middle Kingdom's flourishing of literature continued, we get more and more of a sense of what life was like for ordinary people in the Nile Valley. One text of this period, known as the Papyrus Lansing, gives a fascinating insight into the lives of Egypt's common people. It is written as a piece of rhetoric by a master scribe to one of his pupils, attempting to convince him to become a scribe in turn. From this, we get a wonderful impression of all the ways that people could make their living in the land of Egypt. Young fellow, writing to him who knows it is more profitable than any profession. It is pleasanter than bread and beer, than clothing, than oil. Yes, it is more precious than an inheritance in Egypt, than a tomb in the West. Look for thyself with your own eye. Here, all the professions are set before you. The washerman spends the whole day going up and down. Every limb of his is a weary, whitening the clothes of his neighbors every day. The potter is smeared with mud, like a man in mourning. His hands and feet are full of clay. He is like one who lives in the bog. The cobbler mixes tanning lotions. His odor is marked. His hands are red with dye, like one who is smeared with his blood. The florist makes bouquets and makes the wine jar stands beautiful. He spends a night of toil, sweating like one on whose body the sun is shining. The merchants fare downstream and upstream and are as busy as can be, carrying wares from one town to another and supplying him that hath not. If thou hast any sense, be a scribe. Whether or not daily life was truly that bad for all these other workers, we can't tell, because of course, none of them wrote down how they felt. Most of Egypt's people were peasant farmers, and even when they practiced these other professions, they likely engaged in some farming too. These peasants did not own the land they worked and were required to give most of the food they produced to the crown or to their local temple. To supplement their diets, most houses kept private kitchen gardens too, which the women would tend while the men went out to the fields. Egyptian women were also responsible for baking the bread they ate every day. Bread in Egypt was made primarily with emmer wheat. Dough was often pressed into clay moulds and baked. At times, people got creative, baking bread in spirals like a cinnamon swirl, and using shaped moulds to bake loaves in the form of animals. Those who could afford it
also baked cakes and pastries out of the finest flour, sweetened with dates and honey. Alongside their bread, Egyptians ate a varied diet including garlic and spring onions, lettuce, celery, cucumbers, gourds, and melons. They supplemented these with high protein beans and pulses like lentils and chickpeas, and a kind of edible tuber known as a tiger nut that grows at the base of wetland sedges. All of this was cooked in olive oil, at least from the time the pyramids were built. At times, they would also eat meat, primarily beef, lamb, pork, and goat, as well as quail, pigeon, duck, geese, and partridge. Mice were even eaten at times and even hedgehogs. The Egyptians cooked these spiky creatures by wrapping them in wet clay and baking them in it. When the clay was cracked open afterwards, it took the hedgehog's spines with it. The Egyptians also made cheese and even foie gras made from force-feeding geese. One text written by a scribe to the queen Nefertari urges people to share with others the food they have. Do not eat bread while another stands by without extending your hand to him. As to food, it is here always. It is man who does not last. One man is rich, another is poor, but food remains for him who shares it. Beer was exceptionally popular in Egypt and people consumed it daily. As a result, breweries were important centers of industry. Beer was thought to have been given to Egypt by the goddess Hathor, the goddess of beauty, music, and dancing, and breweries were watched over by the goddess Tenenet. So, fittingly, many beer factories were run by women. Some of these were enormous and were capable of brewing more than a million liters a year. They used large pottery vats propped up on mud bricks over crackling fires, and inside these they heated barley and water, then left the mixture to ferment before flavoring the brew with honey and syrups made of dates and other fruit. There was even one annual festival called the Tek Festival that would become known as the Festival of Drunkenness. During this fiesta, Egyptians would drink as much beer as they could and then fall asleep together in a large hall. They would then be awoken all together by the loud beating of drums. It was said that in the moment just after waking, some of them would meet the goddess Hathor herself. Egypt was one of the most stable and prosperous agricultural societies in the ancient world, but it was a society built entirely on the collection and storage of grain. As a result, there was one ever-present danger, that was the presence of mice and rats. Grain was stored in large circular granaries within the towns, shaped like beehives, and freshly harvested wheat or barley was poured in through a hole in the top to be preserved in the hot, dry air. When grain was needed for bread making or beer brewing, it was taken from a small door in the bottom of these granaries. But if mice got into this storage or even ate the grain while it was still in the fields, then thousands of hours of work could be wasted and people might even starve. But thankfully, Egyptians were able to rely on one particular set of allies. That was the domestic cat. There were two major breeds of wild cat native to Egypt, the jungle cat or Felis Chaus, and the African wild cat, Felis Silvestris Libica. Of these, the African wild cat had something of a calmer temperament and so was most commonly bred as a pet. With evidence of their domestication in Egypt,
from at least 5,000 years ago. These cats were kept around Egyptian settlements for their obvious utility, both in controlling mice and with their almost supernatural reflexes for their ability to kill venomous snakes. But it's clear that the Egyptians also enjoyed their company and even loved them. Some particularly beloved pets were buried with tiny offerings intended to serve them well in the cat afterlife. The Greek writer Diodorus of Sicily recalls seeing Egyptians performing burial ceremonies for their cats. When one of these animals dies, they wrap it in fine linen and then, wailing and beating their breasts, carry it off to be embalmed. After it has been treated with seed oil and such spices as have the quality of imparting a pleasant odor and of preserving the body for a long time, they lay it away in a consecrated tomb. While the earliest domestication of the house cat took place elsewhere in the Fertile Crescent, it was in Egypt that it accelerated dramatically. As cats got used to their new survival niche, they in turn began to adapt. They largely lost their original camouflage coatings, became smaller, and even developed new ways of signaling to their human patrons with soft, insistent cries modulated to similar frequencies as a human baby. Fittingly, the Egyptian word for cat was mew. Over time, this adoration of their feline companions seems to have become a religious reverence, too. With their ease and grace, cats in Egypt were associated with femininity, and paintings in tombs often show the household dog sitting below a man's chair while a cat sits under the woman's chair. One goddess named Bastet would soon become revered and she manifested as a woman with the head of a house cat. Bastet became a god of fertility and women would appeal to her during times of childbirth and pregnancy. Diodorus later records seeing an Egyptian festival during which cats were ritually fed. For the cats, they break up bread into milk and calling them with a clucking sound set it before them, or else they cut up fish caught in the Nile and feed the flesh to them raw. All who meet these animals fall down before them and render them with honor. The Egyptians were also fiercely protective of their feline companions, as Diodorus recounts. Whoever kills a cat, whether intentionally or unintentionally, he is certainly put to death. For common people gathering crowds and deal with the perpetrator most cruelly, sometimes doing this without waiting for a trial. The worship and veneration of cats would continue throughout all the thousands of years of ancient Egyptian history. For the cats, it is perhaps something that they have never quite forgotten. The Middle Kingdom was not just a time of entertainment and pleasure. With the mania for pyramid building somewhat subsided, certain pharaohs engaged in large-scale construction projects to strengthen and develop the empire. One king spent much of his life on a vast irrigation project around the oasis at Fayyum, determined to turn it into a productive swathe of farmland. Another built a large series of defensive walls in the Nile Delta, hemming Egypt off from the people of the wider Middle East whom the Egyptians called Asiatics. These people were often depicted in their paintings with lighter, more yellowish skin than the Egyptians and were held in general contempt as uncivilized barbarians. The Egyptians soon began pushing their sphere of influence into this area, expanding their territory north along the Mediterranean coast and into Palestine. They crossed the Sinai Desert and subjugated the Phoenician city of Byblos. Then, they turned their attention south to Eastern Africa, what the Egyptians called the Haram.
lands, the lands of the Nubians. Like the light-skinned Asiatics in the north, the Egyptians considered the southern Nubians different to them and usually depicted them with darker skin than Egyptians and more typically African features. At this time, these kingdoms were relatively underdeveloped and were easy prey for an aggressive and expansionist Egypt. We've already seen that the first cataract of the Nile was at Aswan, where the granite bedrock forced the water into a series of rushing whitewater rapids. If an ancient Egyptian traveled upriver beyond Aswan and into the horizon lands, they would encounter five more major cataracts of the Nile. These are each places where the river becomes shallow and travel by boat becomes difficult, and so they were natural stops along any journey upriver. They were also the obvious place to draw borders. During the Middle Kingdom, Egypt marched into the horizon lands multiple times and pushed its southern border as far as the second cataract. Around the 1860s BC, one Middle Kingdom king named Senusret III marched even further south into the Nubian kingdoms of Cush and Punt. He remembers this brutal campaign in one inscription. The Nubians are wretches, craven-hearted. My majesty has seen it. It is not an untruth. I have captured their women. I have carried off their subjects, poisoned their wells, killed their cattle, cut down their grains, set fire to it. In this remorseless fashion, Senusret marched beyond the second cataract and built a powerful set of fortresses. We get a sense for their purpose from the names the Egyptians gave to them. One of them at Askut was named Crushing the Nubians, while another at Shalfak was named Subduing the Foreign Lands. In another imposing fortress at Semna, now more than 400 kilometers upstream from the former border of Aswan, Senusret left a stone monument with the following triumphant inscription. Year 16, third month of winter, the king made his southern boundary. I have made my boundary further south than my father's. I have added to what was bequeathed me. As for any son of mine who shall maintain this border which my majesty has made, he is my son. But he who abandons it, who fails to fight for it, he is not my son. He was not born to me. These forts were manned by powerful units of Egyptian soldiers, tasked with keeping order among the newly colonized Nubians. To this end, they engaged in a paranoid surveillance regime of the local people. To the pharaoh Senusret, they sent back constant updates on papyrus scrolls about the movements of even the most minute groups of Nubians, some of which have survived. The patrol who went forth to patrol the desert edge from the fortress Kesev-Mejau in year three, month three of the growing season, last day have come to report to me saying we have found the tracks of 32 men and three donkeys. All these dispatches end in the same way, with the same comforting offer of reassurance to the king. All the affairs of the king's domain are safe and sound. All the affairs of the master are safe and sound. But we have reason to believe that King Senusret was not entirely reassured. He is famous for the numerous sculptures he had made of himself, statues carved from black diorite that depict him in strangely realistic fashion, unlike any depictions of a pharaoh that had come before. In these statues, his ears are extended to enormous proportions like a bat, perhaps projecting the image of a king who heard every movement in his kingdom, relayed by
his extensive system of spies. Three of these statues in particular show the king first as a boy, then as a man, and finally in old age. In this final statue, we get a sense for the mental toll it took on a man to sit at the top of this paranoid system, the pharaoh's weary, sunken eyes, his haggard face contorted in an expression of eternal worry. Today, these three statues stand as a kind of metaphor for the state the Egyptian Middle Kingdom had sunk into during its final decades. Senusret's son, Amenemhat III, did just as his father's inscriptions had urged, and held the southern border against the Nubians. But following his reign, Egypt was once more plunged into a succession crisis. The crisis was so severe that their next king was something that had until then been almost unthinkable, a woman. Her name was Sobeknefru, possibly the daughter, sister, or wife of the previous pharaoh. She was probably not the first woman to hold power in Egypt, but she was the first one to attain the full official title of a king. Sobeknefru used masculine titles in her inscriptions, and one statue of her even shows her wearing an unconventional mixture of male and female clothing. However, she did not succeed in slowing the dynasty's decline. She died after ruling for only four years and did not leave any heirs. After that, the serpent Isfet uncoiled once more, and Egypt slid into chaos. During the time that followed, known as the Second Intermediate Period, there were 150 years during which at least 50 kings ruled. Egypt once again split in two, and local governors stopped mentioning the king in their tomb inscriptions. The pyramids of this period had already become small and meager, mostly built from mud brick. But now, their construction stopped altogether. Some kings were even buried in simple shaft tombs, little better than commoners. Much of the Nile Delta of Lower Egypt had already broken away from the empire, and now in the south, the people of Nubia were in open rebellion. One by one, the Egyptians were forced to let go of their southern forts, abandoning them to the Nubians. Once a symbol of the empire's confidence, these powerful fortresses now became unprecedented military assets for their enemies, and bases from which powerful raiding parties ranged ever farther into Egypt. The cruelty that the Egyptians had shown to their Nubian neighbors was now being paid back in full. With the northern and southern borders convulsed in conflict, Egypt's trade links with the rest of the world were severely disrupted. It was also during this time, or perhaps later, that the entire Mediterranean, in fact most of the world, witnessed one of the largest natural disasters in human history, that is, the eruption of the volcano Thera, now known as the Greek island of Santorini, only 700 kilometers from the Egyptian coast. It's likely that the Egyptians would have heard the deep boom of this explosion, which went off with the force of several hundred atomic bombs. When the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa erupted in 1883, the explosion was heard more than 3,000 kilometers away, and it's thought that the Thera explosion was at least four times more powerful. Today, the seawater-filled volcanic crater left by the eruption is more than 10 kilometers wide. This event may have ejected more than 40 square kilometers of rock into the atmosphere. The black plume would have been riven with volcanic lightning and it would have triggered tsunamis 10 meters high that would have devastated coastal regions, as well as causing a volcanic winter. The eruption may have wiped out the Minoan civilization on Crete in one blow, perhaps inspiring part of the
Atlantis myth, and chronicles as far away as China record a period when the sky turned a strange yellow color and crop yields fell. One Egyptian inscription known as the Tempest Stele may record some memory of this terrifying event. The gods expressed their discontent. The gods made the sky come with a tempest. It caused darkness in the western region. The sky was unleashed, more powerful on the mountains than the turbulence of the cataract at Aswan. Each house, each shelter that they reached were floating in the water like the barks of papyrus outside the royal residence for days. Volcanic ash or tephra would have begun to rain down on the whole region and today can be detected at virtually every site in the eastern Mediterranean. Spurred by this natural disaster and exacerbated by the collapse of the Egyptian administration, soon famine once more descended on the land. Among all of this, a powerful and mysterious force of outsiders must have been watching. They came from the eastern Mediterranean region, from across the Sinai Desert, and they intended to conquer Egypt and rule it for themselves. These people were known as the Hyksos. The word Hyksos comes from the Egyptian phrase Heqau Qesut, meaning rulers of foreign lands. Where exactly the Hyksos were from is unknown, but it's thought they may have originated in the region of Syria. One thing seems to have been behind their great military success, and that was the chariot. At this point, some form of chariot had been used by various societies for many centuries. Vehicles like a kind of war cart with four solid wooden wheels pulled by donkeys are depicted on the Sumerian Standard of Ur, which was created around the time that the Pyramids of Giza were being built. But Egypt had never experimented with this kind of vehicle, and over the preceding millennium, the technology had taken huge leaps forward. The chariots that the Hyksos brought into Egypt for the first time had two wheels with spokes, light and fast, and they were each pulled by two powerful animals that had been recently introduced to the region, the horse. These chariots were strong and mobile battle platforms that could break enemy battle lines, while on-board archers with powerful bows could pelt enemies with missiles. Whether the Hyksos arrived in Egypt as a violent invasion or a more peaceful migration is somewhat up for debate. People from the north had been settling in the Nile Delta for centuries, and much of the population there was already what the Egyptians would consider foreign by the time the Hyksos rulers arrived. But the Hyksos were clearly not pacifists. They set up their own kingdom in the Nile Delta with its capital at Avaris, and in a devastating blow to Egyptian morale, even swept south to capture the ancient capital of Memphis. One much later source named Manetho records the arrival of the Hyksos. By main force, they easily seized the country without striking a blow, and having overpowered the rulers of the land, they then burned our cities ruthlessly, razed to the ground the temples of the gods. Finally, they appointed as king one of the number. He had his seat at Memphis, levying tribute from Upper and Lower Egypt, and always leaving garrisons behind in the most advantageous positions. The pyramids, that great symbol of Egyptian prestige, were now in foreign hands. Egyptian kings would now retreat back to their former in Upper Egypt, the city of Thebes. With the Nubians increasingly powerful in the south, and now the new threat of these Hyksos kings looming from the north, the weakened Egyptians increasingly felt like they were being crushed in a vice.
For a time, it must have seemed like the age of an independent Egypt was over. One king named Camoza, who came to the throne of Thebes around 1555 BC, would put this intolerable situation in the following terms. I should like to know what serves this strength of mine when a chieftain is in Avaris and another in Cush, and I sit united with an Asiatic and a Nubian, each in possession of his slice of Egypt, and I cannot pass by him as far as Memphis. No man can settle down when despoiled by the taxes of the Asiatics. I will grapple with him, that I may rip open his belly. My wish is to save Egypt and to smite the Asiatic. King Camoza may have had a very personal reason to hate the Hyksos. The mummified remains of the previous pharaoh, his father, have been uncovered, and modern analysis shows that he suffered brutal wounds to the head from a heavy bladed weapon. These blows must have sliced his cheek and fractured his jaw and skull, leading many to conclude that he died on the battlefield. The king's body was then rushed back to Thebes, where it was hastily mummified. If Prince Camoza saw his father's body in this state as it was carried back into the city, we can only imagine the kind of hatred that must have burned in his heart towards the Hyksos invaders in the north. But many in Camoza's court were clearly afraid of what a war with the Hyksos would do to the fragile state of the country. One text known as the Carnarvon Tablet describes how they appealed to their king to maintain the peace. We are tranquil in our part of Egypt. Our swan at the first cataract is strong, and the middle part of the land is with us. Men till for us the finest of their lands. They allow our cattle to pasture in the papyrus marshes. Corn is sent for our swine. Our cattle are not taken away. He holds the land of the Asiatics. We hold Egypt. Only when one comes against us should we act against him. As Camoza refused. He wanted to strike a blow at the Hyksos, but he knew that he would have to secure the southern border first, and recapture the old fortress of Buhen just before the second cataract of the Nile. Buhen was one of the strong-walled bastions built by Senesret III, and it was one of the only forts the Egyptians built from stone rather than brick. But since the collapse of the Middle Kingdom, its garrison had served a Nubian lord from the kingdom of Kush. If the southern border was to hold while Camoza expelled the Hyksos in the north, he would need to recapture the fort of Buhen. Camoza marched south, preparing to assault the fort, but it seems that upon sighting the enormous Egyptian army on the horizon, the citizens of the fortress got the message, and decided to swear allegiance to the pharaoh without a fight. With this powerful fort now holding the south, Camoza marched back to Thebes and prepared for the next campaign season, when he would seek to bring war to the Hyksos and unite Egypt once more. In the third year of his reign, Camoza struck. I sailed north in my might to repel the Asiatics through the command of Amun, with my brave army before me like a flame of fire and the archers atop our fighting decks. Camoza's fleet descended swiftly on the Hyksos in what appears to have been something of a surprise attack. Put off guard, the foreigners were defeated, and the vengeance of Camoza was terrible. When day dawned, I was upon him as if it were a hawk. When breakfast time came, I overthrew him, having destroyed his walls and slaughtered his people, and made his wife descend to the riverbank. My army acted like lions with their spoil, chattels, cattle, fat, honey, dividing their things, their hearts' joy.
As for Avaris on the two rivers, I laid it waste without inhabitants. I destroyed their towns and burned their homes to reddened ruin heaps forever. Because of the destruction they had wrought in the midst of Egypt, they who had allowed themselves to hearken to the call of the Asiatics had forsaken Egypt, their mistress. The king of the Hyksos immediately appealed to his Nubian ally, the king of Kush, for help. At one point, the Egyptians intercepted a secret message travelling south along the desert roads, the contents of which they recorded. Have you noticed what Egypt has done against me? The ruler who is there, Kamosi, penetrates my territory even though I have not attacked him as he has you. He chooses these two lands in order to afflict them, my land and yours, and he has ravaged them. Come northward, do not flinch, then we shall divide up the towns of Egypt. When this messenger returned to the embattled Hyksos king, shamefaced and with the letter undelivered, he must have known that all was lost. The war came to a swift end and Kamosi recounts, with perhaps some exaggeration, his heroic return to Thebes. What a happy home trip for the ruler, life, prosperity, happiness. With his army ahead of him, they had no casualties, nor did anyone blame his fellow, nor did their hearts weep. I moored on home soil during the season of inundation. The riverbank was resplendent. Thebes was festive. Women and men had come to see me. Every woman hugged her neighbour. No one was tearful. His son, Achmosa, would press this advantage, and in an even more devastating campaign, seized the ancient capital of Memphis. Achmosa would be the first pharaoh in at least a hundred years to recapture the great pyramids of Giza. We can imagine his feelings as he gazed up at the monuments of his ancestors, Khufu and Khafre, by now already more than a thousand years old. It's clear that the sight inspired him, and he would even build a pyramid of his own in Upper Egypt at the site of Abydos. This was one of the first pyramids built for an Egyptian pharaoh since the fall of the Middle Kingdom, and it was clearly designed as a symbol of renewal of the empire's great legacy. But it would also be the last ever pyramid built by an Egyptian ruler. After securing the Nile Delta, Achmosa marched north and even crossed the Sinai, smashing through the traditional heartland of the Hyksos people and seizing territory in Palestine, in the region of modern Gaza. After that, he returned to the southern people of Kush and pushed the empire's borders farther south than they had ever been, beyond the second cataract to the river island of Sai, now in northern Sudan. From its lowest ebb, Egypt had suddenly re-emerged as a major regional power. This was the age of the New Kingdom. During the five centuries of the New Kingdom, Egypt would reach its greatest territorial extent and construct some of its most impressive monuments and artifacts. Despite recapturing Memphis, its kings saw no reason to move the capital again, and so they now once again ruled from the city of Thebes, far up the river in Upper Egypt. By now, Egypt had also adopted the technology of the horse-drawn chariot from their Hyksos foes, and its armies were now made up of powerful contingents of these vehicles. During these centuries, Egypt saw the rule of its first great woman pharaoh, Hatshepsut, who was one of its most prolific builders. She constructed the towering temple complex at Karnak, and the stately mortuary temple known as the Holy of Holies. She also undertook a voyage in five ships to the land of Punt, somewhere in Africa,
brought back incense trees and other goods to Egypt, which she celebrated in one inscription. The ships returned with the marvels of the land of Punt, and with all the good woods of Tanuta, with heaps of incense, with trees producing green fragrance, with ebony and pure ivory, with gold and green agates found in the land of the Amu, with hides of the panthers of the south. Never since the beginning of the world have the like of these wonders been brought by any king. The New Kingdom would also see some of the most striking dramas emerge in the royal courts of Egypt. Of these, none have drawn so much attention as the story of one pharaoh. He has been described by some as a revolutionary, by others as a visionary, and by others still as simply insane. He was a ruler named Amunhotep IV. Amunhotep came to the throne around 1350 BC. He had inherited his name from his father, who had ruled as Amunhotep III. Like most Egyptian names, it included the name of a god, Amun, and it meant Amun is satisfied. Amun had long been the god of the city of Thebes, and was considered the god of fertility and of the wind. But when the Hyksos were expelled from Egypt and Thebes became the capital once more, this god Amun was given something of a promotion. He was unified with the sun god Ra to create a compound deity now known as Amun-Ra, the perfect symbol of the power of a new, united Egypt. Amun-Ra was depicted as a man bearing a golden staff and wearing a high crown, and later would be shown with blue skin. This new deity was placed at the head of all the various gods that the Egyptians worshipped, the king of the gods and creator of the universe. One hymn to Amun-Ra describes the primacy of his position. Lord of truth, father of the gods, maker of men, creator of all animals, lord of things that are, creator of the staff of life. The pharaoh Amun-Hotep IV would keep his name for the first four years of his rule. But around his fifth year on the throne, he made the unprecedented decision to change his royal name. That's because he had a vision of a new system of belief that he wanted to spread over all of Egypt. He wanted to do away with the messiness of Egyptian religion and the system of different gods in different cities, different temples and cults and priests. He devised a new system of worship that focused not on any god, but on the sun itself, which he seems to have believed was his true father. This new god would be depicted as a bare, impersonal disk showering the earth with beams of light. It would be called simply the orb, or in Egyptian, the Aten. One surviving hymn to the Aten, perhaps even written by the pharaoh himself, shows the enormous power this new god was supposed to have. O soul god, like whom there is no other, thou didst create the world according to thy desire. You are in my heart, there is no other who knows you. Every land chatters at his rising every day. Around year five of his reign, the pharaoh Amunhotep abandoned his old name that paid respect to the god Amun and changed it to a new name for his new god. This new name meant affective spirit for the Aten. He was now the pharaoh Akhenaten. Akhenaten is the first recorded person in history to have started a new religion by himself. He was also the first monotheist.
In Akhenaten's kingdom, only the Aten could be worshipped. Temples to Amun were eventually shut down and all worship of the former god was banned. The king even sent out workmen and soldiers to all corners of Egypt where they burst into temples with hammers and chisels and chipped the name of Amun off the walls. His determination to rid his kingdom of Amun was so great that he even sent workmen climbing to the top of the Red Pyramid of Snefru to chip the name of Amun from the pyramid's topmost capstone. To the Egyptians, used as they were to placating a whole host of deities with prayers and offerings, this radical shift must have seemed like a frightening and risky gamble. Many must have feared to turn their backs on their old trusted gods and consort with this new and untested ideology. But the king's word was the king's word, and for the most part, they seem to have fallen into line. At first, Akhenaten converted old temples in Thebes to the Aten and even began constructing some new ones, but he soon went off the idea. Thebes' old temples were covered with carvings and hieroglyphs praising the other gods, and the depth of their history couldn't be erased overnight. Thebes was also home to a powerful priestly class that resisted his reforms. In answer to this problem, Akhenaten took the remarkable decision to build an entirely new capital. He would build it out in the middle of the desert at a completely uninhabited location halfway between Memphis and Thebes. He would call this city the horizon of the Aten, or in Egyptian, Akhetaten. Standing out on the bare and level plain where he hoped to build his new city, the pharaoh Akhenaten gave the following proclamation to his courtiers. The Aten desires that there be made for him a monument with an eternal and everlasting name. It is Aten, my father, who gave me counsel concerning it. No official has ever given me counsel, not any of the people who are in the entire land. At Akhetaten, I shall make the house of Aten. This new city would be furnished with everything a royal capital needed. Palaces for Akhenaten and his chief wife Nefertiti, along with his four other wives, gardens, tombs, administrative buildings, and workshops, and of course, a vast temple complex to the new god, Aten. Construction of this city would take at least eight years, and when it was finished in the twelfth year of his reign, Akhenaten held a magnificent ceremony. The year was 1342 BC. At his new capital, Akhenaten received delegations from all over the region, from the Hittites, from Syria and islands in the Mediterranean like Cyprus and Crete, as well as from the Nubian lands of Punt and Kush in the south, all here to bear witness to the glory of his new city and his successful conversion of his empire. The priests may have grumbled, the common people may have fretted, but he had finally done it. The ceremony must have been grand, full of celebration and pomp, musicians and dancers, the burning of incense and feasts of fine foods. We can imagine the foreign guests listening to the singing of hymns like the following to the new god, Aten. Thou didst create the world according to thy desire, all men, cattle, and wild beasts, whatever is on earth going upon its feet, and what is on high, flying with its wings. The countries of Syria and Nubia, the land of Egypt, thou settest every man in his place. Thou supplyest their necessities, their tongues are separate in speech, and their natures as well. Everyone has his food, and his time of life is reckoned.
But the consequences of this piece of royal pageantry were dire. A plague had been spreading around the Middle East for some time now, affecting lands in Syria and the Hittite Empire in what is now Turkey. One group of texts written around this time, known as the Hittite Plague Prayers, invoke the gods to deliver them from this disaster. For twenty years now, people have been dying in Hatti. Will the plague never be removed from Hatti? I cannot control the worry in my heart. I can no longer control the anguish of my soul. With foreign dignitaries coming from all over the region, with large entourages and doubtless groups of slaves in tow, a deadly dose of this disease arrived that year in the heart of Egypt, and from there, would have spread all up and down the Nile. If Akhenaten had hoped that this ceremony would secure his people's confidence in his new god, then it couldn't have backfired more dramatically. In the pandemic that followed, no one was safe. Numerous deaths may even have occurred within Akhenaten's family, perhaps including his mother, his wife, and three of his daughters. If the situation was so severe, even in the relatively protected royal court, we can assume that in the population at large, the effects were even more devastating. For the people of Egypt, this incomprehensible disaster must have seemed like the judgment of the old gods on the man who had so arrogantly turned his back on them. Akhenaten died only a few years later, around 1335 BC, after 17 years of rule. After his death, some members of his family attempted to maintain the cult of the Aten in the now plague-ravaged new capital of Akhetaten. They would take turns to rule for the next four years, but seemingly without much success. Now, the whole empire seemed like it was teetering on the brink of collapse. But eventually, one of Akhenaten's sons, a boy of only eight years old, came to the throne. His father had given him the hopeful name Tutankhaten, or living image of the Aten, but he would not rule under it for long. Turning his back on his father's new faith and to enormous celebration around the empire, in the third year of his rule, he changed his name to the one we now remember him by. The living image not of Aten, but of the old god Amun, now triumphantly welcomed back by the people of Egypt. His name was Tutankhamun. As symbolized by his change of name, the boy king Tutankhamun rode back a great number of his father's attempted reforms. He ended all worship of the god Aten and reinstated Amun to supremacy in Thebes. Tutankhamun lifted the ban on the cults of other gods and restored the traditional privileges of the priesthood. Many temples to the Aten in Thebes and elsewhere were torn down, and their painted bricks were used as filler in the walls of other temples. Everyone seemed to be in agreement. The whole sorry business of Akhenaten was better off forgotten. Today, the boy king Tutankhamun is perhaps the most famous of all the Egyptian pharaohs. More famous than the great Khufu and Khafre of Giza, or the pharaohs Djoser and Snefru, who perfected the pyramid form. He's more famous than Khamoza or Ahmoza, who reunited the kingdom and expelled the Hyksos. More famous than his colorful father Akhenaten, or the great queen Hatshepsut. But there's nothing in his reign that really warrants that level of recognition. In fact, this boy king died while still a teenager, after only nine years of rule. He does seem to have been a good king and popular, and set Egypt back on course after his father's erratic reign. But the source of his fame was really one of absolute historical accident.
When he died in 1323 BC, the boy-king Tutankhamun was buried in a tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was not a particularly resplendent royal tomb, and a far cry from the glorious pyramids of the old kingdom. But shortly after it was sealed, there was a chance flash flood in this portion of the necropolis, and the doorway to the tomb was buried in sand and rock. This left it completely concealed. For the next 3,300 years, tomb robbers would scour the Valley of the Kings, stealing from nearly every one of the great pharaohs' tombs, making away with their treasures, removing their mummies, and despoiling their decorations. But buried in the sand, Tutankhamun's tomb remained sealed. For this reason, it was completely untouched until the year 1922, when it was uncovered by the Egyptologist Howard Carter, and all its artifacts were recovered to international astonishment. Today, the most glorious of these, the golden burial mask of Tutankhamun, is one of the most famous objects from the ancient world, a resplendent image of royal wealth and power. At times it can be hard to remember that this golden image is also a portrait of a boy who had power thrust upon him in a time of upheaval and strife, looking up at us from the dark depths of the ages. The new kingdom of Egypt would reach its highest point around 50 years after the reign of Tutankhamun. It would come during the rule of perhaps the greatest Egyptian pharaoh. He came to the throne under the name Ramesses II, but he would go down in history as Ramesses the Great. Ramesses came to the throne at the age of 14, in 1279 BC. At the time, Egypt's Mediterranean coast was being ravaged by groups of pirates, and he spent much of his early rule dealing with this nuisance. But he is most famous for pushing the boundaries of Egypt far to the north, into the region of Syria. Over the preceding centuries, a powerful rival had grown up in the mountains of what is today Turkey and was steadily spreading its influence in all directions. This was the powerful Hittite Empire, centered on their hill fortress capital of Hattusha. The Hittites were a relatively new power in the region, but their territory was wealthy and extensive. They had mastered the use of chariots in warfare, turning them from light hit-and-run vehicles into heavy armoured shock troops. For the last two centuries, Egypt had been fighting increasingly bitter wars with them over who would control the region of Palestine. In the fourth year of his reign, Ramesses II gathered an expeditionary force and marched across the Sinai Desert to Gaza, and from there, marched north. One epic poem written about this expedition exults in the enormous force that Ramesses brought. His majesty journeyed northward, his infantry and chariotry with him. He began to march on the good way. Every foreign country was trembling before him, their chiefs were bringing their tribute and all the rebels were coming, bowing down to a dread of the personality of his majesty. Ramesses' aim was to capture the strong fortress city of Kadesh, situated along the sandy banks on a fork of the Orontes River. For years now, Kadesh had been playing the Hittites and Egypt off against one another, allying first with one, then the other. Now, Ramesses was determined to finally seize Kadesh for Egypt. He marched north with four of his divisions, named after the gods Amun, Ra, Seth, and Ptah. With him, he brought thousands of chariots, and one unit of elite chariot riders he sent by sea.
telling them to land on the coast and ride inland to meet him on the day that he arrived at Kadesh. At first, everything seemed to be going well. On his way, the Pharaoh's scouts captured a pair of tribesmen from the Shasu people who told him that the Hittite king was cowering further to the north. He was afraid of the might of Egypt, they said. He had left Kadesh defenseless. Excited by this news, Ramesses threw all caution to the wind and hastened northward to seize the city with only one of his four divisions, his prided Amun troops. But this would prove to be a fatal mistake. Ramesses didn't know it yet, but these Shasu tribesmen were actually agents of the Hittite king, sent to lure him into a trap. When he arrived at Kadesh, Ramesses set up his camp beside a stony brook, and his scouts set out into the surrounding landscape to detect any threats. Some of these scouts ran into a pair of Hittite soldiers who had been lying low in the undergrowth, watching them. They skirmished, and the Egyptians managed to capture the Hittites. After perhaps a stern beating, these men revealed what lay waiting for the Egyptians nearby, the full might of the Hittite armies amassed in an ambush, hidden behind the looming fortress of Kadesh. The Kadesh poem records this imposing force. Now the wretched foe of Hatti had come, having gathered all foreign countries to the very ends of the sea, the land of Hatti in its entirety. They covered the mountains and the valleys like the grasshoppers with their multitudes. He left neither silver nor gold in his land, but despoiled it of all its possessions and gave them to all foreign countries to bring them with him to combat. Ramesses flew into a rage with his generals for allowing this to happen. He had hurried ahead with his Amun division, and now he was critically overstretched, with his reinforcements in the Ra division still on the road. The Hittites would not allow the Egyptians to regroup. Before the Ra division could arrive, a terrifying force of 2,500 Hittite chariots burst out of hiding and swept across the river plain. Hittite chariots were the tanks of their day, heavy and armored, their riders covered in chainmail down to their toes. These chariots rolled in and smashed into the Ra regiment, who frantically tried to form a shield wall. The Hittites scattered this division completely and then rounded on the Egyptians' camp. Ramesses was surrounded, cut off from his reinforcements, and now outnumbered. But in this dire situation, he recounts how he rallied his men and led them in a desperate charge against the enemy. I found the 2,500 spans of chariotry in whose midst I was, becoming heaps of corpses before my horses. Not one of them found his hand to fight, for their hearts quailed in their bodies from terror of me. And all their arms were powerless, so they could not shoot nor find their courage to seize their javelins. Whether or not this self-aggrandizing account is an accurate depiction of that day, it's clear that the tide did begin to turn. The Egyptian soldiers were elite fighters and many of the Hittite forces may have been mercenaries or conscripts. After destroying the Ra division and sweeping into the Egyptians' camp, the chariots became bogged down and many of the Hittite soldiers, believing the battle to be already over, began looting rather than press their advantage. More Egyptian reinforcements were soon arriving from the south, and as the bloody afternoon wore on, that contingent of elite charioteers that had been sailing up the coast also arrived on the scene. The arrival of this cavalry on the horizon was enough to steal the resolve of the Egyptian troops and break the will of the Hittites. Ramesses gives a florid rendition of what happened.
happened next. The Hittite army withdrew, with many of their soldiers pushed into the Orontes River. When the next day dawned, the two sides clashed again, but both had been fatally weakened by the previous day's fighting. After a few hours of bloody slaughter, Ramesses withdrew and the Hittite king sent him a peace offer. The pharaoh's hands were tied. The Egyptians lacked any siege equipment to breach the strong walls of Kadesh, and the only option to take the city would have been a lengthy siege, during which Ramesses would have found his forces exposed to attack, poorly supplied and prone to encirclement. Instead, he decided to declare victory and march back to Egypt. The Hittites, in turn, also declared victory, and the city of Kadesh would slip out of Ramesses' grasp. Despite the overflowing praise of Ramesses and his glorious victory in the Kadesh poem, the war actually ended with a stalemate, and the question of the city remained unresolved. But it's clear that Ramesses thought back to his role during the battle with no small amount of pride, and he would decorate the walls of his temple at Abu Simbel with a vast low-relief carving of every one of the battle's twists and turns. The war with the Hittites would drag on for a further 15 years, and during this time, Egypt would often capture territory along the Mediterranean coast, only to lose it again the very next year. Before long, both sides grew weary of this grinding conflict. The war was finally brought to an end with what has gone down in history as the first written peace treaty, the text of which has survived. Behold, Hattusali, the ruler of the Hittites, binds himself by treaty to Ramesses, chosen one of Ra, the great ruler of Egypt, beginning today, so that perfect peace and brotherhood may be created between us forever. He being in brotherhood and peace with me, and I being in brotherhood and peace with him forever. The treaty was written on silver tablets, with both the Hittites and the Egyptians being given a copy. This text was written in both hieroglyphics and Hittite cuneiform, but the two translations do have slightly different wordings. In a diplomatic stroke of genius, the Egyptian version claims that the Hittites had come begging Egypt for peace, which the Egyptians graciously accepted, while in the Hittite version, it is the Egyptians who asked to end the war. With both sides thus able to save face, the destructive conflict was allowed to come to an end, and nearly a century of relative peace ensued. Despite the pride Ramesses took in his battles, today it is this peace treaty that we most remember, and a replica of it hangs on the walls of the United Nations headquarters in New York. After what seemed like a lucky escape at Kadesh, Ramesses would turn his attention away from war and towards construction. He spent the next decades of his rule building temples and monuments up and down Egypt, and today his name is the one that appears on the most surviving monuments of any pharaoh. This is partly due to his prolific building campaign, but also due to the fact that he ensured his name was inscribed more deeply in the stone than any other pharaoh, so deep that it could never be erased. Ramesses II would rule for a total of 66 years, and would be remembered as perhaps Egypt's greatest pharaoh. His full Egyptian name was Uzumatre Setepenre Ramses.
which the Greeks would later render into a name they found easier to pronounce. They would call him Ozymandias. More than a thousand years later, the Greek writer Diodorus of Sicily would visit Egypt and write an account of visiting one monument to Ramesses II. At its entrance, there is a pylon constructed of variegated stone two plethora in breadth and 45 cubits high. The inscription upon its runs, King of kings am I, Ozymandias. If anyone would know how great I am and where I lie, let him surpass one of my works. Ramesses would also build a new capital for his empire and with his military ambitions lying in the north, he decided to place it in the northeast of the Nile Delta, and in characteristic fashion, he named it after himself, calling it Per Ramses or the House of Ramesses. One Egyptian poem would celebrate the beauty of this new city. The residence is pleasant in life. Its field is full of everything good. It is full of supplies and food every day. Its ponds with fish and its lakes with birds. Its meadows are verdant with grass. Its banks bear dates. Its melons are abundant on the sands. Its granaries are so full of barley and emmer wheat that they come near to the sky. Red-wedged fish swim in the canal of the resident city which live on lotus flowers. This city of Per Ramses has long been associated with the city of Ramses referred to in the Hebrew book of Exodus, the second book of the Hebrew Bible. Exodus describes a population of enslaved Hebrews forced to work on the construction of the city. The reality of the Exodus story has long been debated, and most historians now consider it to be a piece of ancient literature. There is no evidence for a large population of Hebrew slaves ever living in Egypt, or that the city of Per Ramses was built by slaves at all. More likely, it was built using the Egyptians' usual combination of skilled artisans and seasonal peasant laborers. But with the proximity of the Nile Delta to the Levantine coast, it's certainly not impossible that some of these laborers were Hebrew people who had traveled across the Sinai to sell their labor in Egypt. If that were the case, then for one reason or another, they left no impression in the archaeological record, but perhaps printed an indelible mark on our collective imaginations. When Ramses finally died in 1213 BC, he was probably nearly 90 years old. His reign had been one of Egypt's golden ages, but his long rule had once again created that old king problem. All of his heirs were now also old men. By the time of his death, twelve of his oldest sons had already died, and now his thirteenth son took the throne at the age of about 70. He was the pharaoh Merneptah. But only a few years into this man's reign, Egypt was attacked by a devastating new enemy. These were the Libyan people to the west of the Nile Delta. The king of Libya, a man named Merire, had seemingly planned his attack for some time. All of a sudden, a large Libyan army suddenly flooded through Egypt's northwestern border, and they were reinforced with groups of people from all over the Mediterranean, perhaps from Greece, Sardinia, Sicily, and elsewhere across the sea. These were a diverse group of peoples that had suddenly begun to appear in increasing numbers across the eastern Mediterranean. They would later become known as the Sea Peoples. The pharaoh Merneptah remembers this event on one carved stelae. The wretched fallen chief of Libya, Merire, son of dead, has fallen upon the country of Tehunu with his bowmen.
Sherdan, Shekelesh, Ekwesh, Luka, Tiresh, taking the best of every warrior and every man of war of his country. He has brought his wife and his children, leaders of the camp, and he has reached the western boundary in the fields of Perea. The pharaoh Merneptah defeated this invasion, and as a warning to any others who would try a surprise attack, he had many of the invading soldiers impaled along the road into Memphis. The princes are prostrate, saying, Mercy! Not one raises his head among the nine bows. Desolation is for Tehenu. Hati is pacified, plundered as the Canaan with every evil. Her eyes become a widow. All lands together they are pacified. But these lands would not stay pacified for long. After the death of the pharaoh Merneptah around 1204 BC, Egypt entered a period of civil strife, with the descendants of Ramesses fighting over who would take the crown. Against this backdrop, the entire region also once again began to experience a series of record droughts. What caused this climate shift is uncertain. As we saw in our second episode on the Bronze Age collapse, the cause may have been volcanic, with a large eruption taking place in the Icelandic volcano of Hekla around this time. Others have proposed that an eruption in Sicily around 1300 BC may have been to blame, or that the supervolcano Thera in Santorini may have resumed some activity some 500 years after its last enormous eruption. The cause may not have been volcanic at all, and could have been due to variations in the sun's activity, or weather systems in the Atlantic depriving the Mediterranean of moisture. The reality was much as it is today. The planet's climate system is fragile, interconnected, and chaotic, and even relatively small changes in its equilibrium can have devastating effects. During this time, formerly green lands became dry and arid, and more plants suited to desert landscapes flourished. Analysis of sediment cores and oxygen isotopes in cave mineral deposits have all shown that the 13th and 12th centuries BC saw much less rain than the preceding centuries. Alongside this scientific evidence, we can see marks of severe drought in the region's written records too. Europe's great rivals, the Hittites, in their stony mountains, were hit particularly hard by the drought. One Hittite text has come down to us that seems to capture the spirit of this age, and it is known as the myth of Telepino. It comes from a poetic convention known as the vanishing god myth, which describes how a certain deity is so offended by the misdeeds of humanity that he flies into a fit of sorrow and abandons his duties. Telepino was a god of farming, fertility, and the weather. The beginning of the text has been lost, so we don't know what it was humanity did to provoke his rage, but the poem describes its deadly consequences. Whereupon soot beset the windows, smoke beset the house, the ashes lay crammed on the hearth. Off stalked Telepino, grain and abundance he took away from field and meadow. Off to the copses stalked Telepino, and in a copse he buried himself. Forthwith the seed ceased to yield produce, oxen, sheep, and men ceased to breed, while even those that had conceived did not bear. Hillsides were bare, trees were bare, and put forth no new branches. Pastures were bare, springs ran dry. A famine arose in the land, men and gods alike were about to perish of hunger.
While the Egyptians may have celebrated this weakening of their great rival, in Egypt, the situation was hardly any better. One text dated to around the year 1200 BC is called the Lament to Amun, and it stands as a wail of sorrow in a darkening age. Come to me, Father Amun. Protect me in this bitter year of confrontation. God shines in the sun, yet he will not shine. Winter crowds hard upon summer. Months happen backwards. Disheveled hours lurch drunken by. Those cut down in high places cry out to you, Amun. These words came on the poisoned air, spoken by herdsmen in fields and marshes, by those who beat clothes on the banks of the river, by district police deserting their precincts, by horned beasts on our burning deserts. From this period of unrest and the chaos in Egypt's royal court, which lasted for about a century, a military strongman named Setnachte would eventually rise to power. He would rule for only three years before dying and passing the throne on to his young son. This boy was the empire's last hope to turn around its floundering fortunes, and if such a hope was to be sustained, there was only one name he could possibly rule under. His parents would name him after his great predecessor, who had ruled nearly a century before and fought at the Battle of Kadesh, and so this boy would rule as Ramesses III. This new boy-king, Ramesses, was a determined and tenacious ruler, and it's clear that he openly admired and sought to emulate the legendary Pharaoh of old. He even went so far as to name all his own sons after the sons of Ramesses II, and also gave them all the same positions in his court. It was clear he wanted to do everything he could to recreate the glory days that had slipped out of Egypt's grasp, as he writes in one of his inscriptions. Rejoice ye, O Egypt, to the height of heaven, for I am ruler of the south and north upon the throne of Atum. The gods have appointed me to be king over Egypt, to be victor, to expel them for her from the countries. They decreed to me the kingdom while I was a child, and my reign is full of plenty. Under other circumstances, Ramesses might have been one of Egypt's great rulers, but the entire region was soon to be convulsed in a series of bitter wars. One of the great drivers of these conflicts was the loose collection of peoples that had first appeared in the reign of the Pharaoh Merneptah, and who are known as the Sea Peoples. These invaders were now descending on the entire region in ever greater numbers, apparently spurred by widespread crop failures in northern and western Europe. Already powerful trading cities like the port town of Ugarit had been attacked by sea, seemingly by complete surprise, and they were destroyed so thoroughly that they were never reoccupied. The Egyptians' great rivals, the Hittites, were now on the brink of collapse as trade networks around the region went into freefall. Ramesses remembers this time of strife as these northern invaders descended on the coast. The countries, the northerners in their isles were disturbed, swept away in battle. Not one stood before their lands. From Keta, Karchemish, Arvat, Alasa, they were wasted. They set up a camp in one place in Amor. They desolated his people and his land like that which is not. When news of the Sea People's attacks came to Ramesses, he would have been Pharaoh for about eight years. He had already repelled two further invasions from Libya and must have
been rising in confidence, but the news troubled him and soon he got word that the fleet of the Sea Peoples was on the move and were heading to Egypt, as he recounts in the inscription on his mortuary temple at Medinet Habu. They came with fire prepared before them, forward to Egypt. Their main support was Peleset. Thekel, Shekelesh, Denyen, and Weshesh. Their lands were united and they laid their hands upon the land as far as the circle of the earth. Their hearts were confident, full of their plans. Ramesses knew that these attackers would have to be stopped and he decided that he would make his stand at the mouth of the Nile, the lush, fertile delta. He would have to play to what strengths the Egyptian army still had in this challenging terrain. He decided to lay an ambush and give the Sea Peoples a surprise attack of their own. Now, it happened through this god, the lord of gods, that I was prepared and armed to trap them like wild fowl. I equipped my frontier at Zayi, prepared before them. The chiefs, the captains of infantry, the nobles, I caused to equip the harbor mouths like a strong wall, with warships, galleys, and barges. They were manned completely from bow to stern, with valiant warriors bearing their arms, soldiers of all the choicest of Egypt, being like lions roaring upon the mountaintops. Their horses were quivering in their every limb, ready to crush the countries under their feet. As the enemy's ships amassed, Ramesses gathered archers on the banks, supported by spearmen and cavalry in their thousands, all concealed in the reeds. The tension must have been tremendous. All the soldiers of the Egyptian army, holding their breath and waiting for that first sign of an enemy ship. Then at last, a sail was sighted. After that came another and another, until the whole fleet of the Sea Peoples was in sight. The Egyptians must have been able to hear the creak of 10,000 oars, the beating of the drums, the shouts of the helmsmen and soldiers. Then, once the Sea Peoples' ships were within range, Ramesses struck. Arrows flew out of the reeds and rained down on the ships. Panicked, the invaders attempted to land on the banks, but as they did, the Egyptian spearmen appeared out of the treeline and met them with a shield wall. While the enemy was held at bay, the Egyptian navy sailed in down the river. Those who reached my boundary, their heart and their soul are finished forever and ever. As for those who had assembled before them on the sea, the full flame was in their front, before the harbor mouth, and a wall of metal upon the shore surrounded them. They were dragged, overturned, and laid low upon the beach, slain, and made heaps from stern to bow of their galleys, while all their things were cast upon the water. Thus, I turned back the waters to remember Egypt, and when they even mention my name in their land, may it consume them with fear. The pharaoh's plan had worked. The Egyptians were the first people to turn back these seagoing invaders and stop their campaign of destruction. Ramesses' inscription at Medinet Habu ends on the following triumphant note. Rejoice ye, O Egypt, of the height of heaven, for I am ruler of the south and north upon the throne of Adam. I have expelled your mourning which was in your heart, and I have made you dwell in peace. Those whom I have overthrown shall not return. But despite their victory, the land of the pharaohs now stood alone in a devastated region.
other society around them had been gutted and reduced to ash. Numerous long established civilizations, the Mycenaean Greeks, the Hittites, Ugarit, and Babylon had collapsed, and civil order had given way to chaos. The precarious trade routes on which they had all relied to supply them with bronze and other commodities were now broken, and Egypt's economy went into a steep and unstoppable decline. By the end of this period, which has become known as the Late Bronze Age Collapse, Egypt was a shadow of its former self. As other enemies encroached on its borders, Egypt was able to fight them off, but its treasury became so depleted that it never fully recovered its imperial power. The first workers strike in recorded history happened during the 29th year of Ramses III's reign, when Egypt could no longer provide food rations for its elite artisans who were constructing the king's tomb in the village of Deir el-Medina. The lack of rations went on so long that the workers eventually marched through the town, shouting the following chant. We're hungry. There's no more clothing, no more oil, no more fish, no more vegetables. Send word to the Pharaoh. If food was not reaching these crucial workers, we can only imagine the dire situation in the wider kingdom. The dispute dragged on for weeks, with one leader of the protest even threatening to damage a royal monument if they were not paid. It was a threat that they would never have dared to make unless the authority of the Pharaoh was beginning to be seriously undermined. Ramses III ruled for another two decades after his battle with the Sea Peoples, for a total reign of 31 years. But by the year 1156 BC, some members of his family were beginning to get impatient. In the Egyptian court, all of the women, the king's wives and mother, and other consorts all lived together in a large palace complex with its own land. This was convenient for the king but it could also encourage courtly intrigue. There was a strict hierarchy to the Pharaoh's queens, and everyone knew that the children of his main wife were to be his heirs before any others. Some of the women who were lower down on this ladder could at times resort to plotting to improve their stations, and perhaps get their own sons on the throne instead. One of these women was a queen named Teie. Teie was a secondary wife of Ramses, and her son Pentawerr was not in line for the throne. In order to remedy this situation, she began a plot that would go down in history as the Haram Conspiracy. Soon, she brought in other members of the king's household, and even high-ranking members of the government, as one later papyrus records. They are the abomination of the land. The great criminal who was then chief of the chamber was in collusion with Teie and the women of the Harem. He had made common cause with them. He had begun to bring out their words to their mothers and their brothers who were there saying, stir up the people, incite rebellion against their lord. Alarmingly, one of the palace women had written to her brother named Kayem Waset, a commander of Nubian troops in the south, and gained his support for their plot. Others had even turned to supernatural methods, making wax effigies of the king's bodyguards and laying curses on them to help their scheme. Their plan was clear, to kill Ramesses and install Queen Teie's son Pentawerr as pharaoh. The date they chose to strike was during the annual ceremony known as the beautiful Festival of the Valley, which was held in Thebes every year at the new moon of the second month of the harvesting season of Shemu. During this festival, which was one of the
biggest of the year, the pharaoh would go down to the river in a grand and colorful procession, carrying the statues of the three gods of Thebes, Amun, Mut, and Khonsu. He would then board his royal barge and sail with the statues down to the Theban necropolis to visit his grand temple, as one inscription by a Theban priest describes. We go, giving praise to Amun, kissing the ground before the lords of the gods on his festivals, the first day of Shemu shining, on the day of voyaging to the valley. Here, the citizens would give offerings of food and drink and flowers as the boats sailed on the river with the three statues. As the riotous, days-long festival progressed, the plotters took advantage of the disruption to make a strike at the king. It was day 15 of Shemu when the pharaoh was relaxing in the royal harem in the western tower of Medinet Habu, perhaps thinking ahead to his role in the coming festivities, when a group of assassins crept up on him with knives. Their attack was swift and brutal. Modern scanning of Ramesses III's mummy reveals that his throat was cut right to the bone with a sharp weapon, severing the trachea, esophagus, and major blood vessels. Death would have followed within seconds. Ramesses has no defensive wounds, suggesting that he was caught completely unawares. But curiously, his big toe was severed at the time of the attack. This seems like an unlikely injury to sustain during a struggle, and studies of his mummy have shown that the Mbamas fashioned him a prosthetic toe to take with him into the afterlife. This suggests that the original toe was never recovered, perhaps indicating that someone took it as proof that he was dead, or as a grisly trophy. Ramesses III had saved Egypt from the sea peoples, but now he lay dying in a pool of his own blood, betrayed by his own family. But the conspirator's plot would not go as planned. In the aftermath of the bloody assassination, the son of Ramesses III was able to crush the coup and seize the throne. The plotters were all put on trial, as well as any who had heard about the conspiracy but failed to report it. In all, 28 people were executed, and as a final punishment, they were even cruelly renamed after their deaths. The brother of one of the plotters, who had commanded his Nubian troops in the south, was originally named Kayemwaset, a name which meant came from Thebes. But after his execution, he was renamed Binemwaset, or evil in Thebes. Another's name, Merira, meant beloved of Ra, but he was given the somewhat spiteful new name, Mesedzura, or Ra hates him. Although order had been restored to the royal succession, Egypt was in a much reduced state. The death of Ramesses was followed by years of bickering among his heirs. Three of his sons would become king at different times, each feeling the need to memorialize him and shore up their own legitimacy by reigning as Ramesses IV, VI, and VIII. In fact, the next eight pharaohs in a row would all be named Ramesses after the slain king. But many of these rulers were ineffectual and reigned for only a few years each. Meanwhile, Egypt was increasingly beset by continuing droughts, lack of seasonal floodwaters, famines, civil unrest, and official corruption. Against this backdrop by the rule of Ramesses XI, a new power had begun to fill the vacuum left by royal authority. These were the high priests of Amun in Thebes. This priesthood had become not only very powerful, but exceedingly wealthy, through a century's-long display of fortune. Some say it had been thanks to the deceit of Amun and the deception of his spy,
long game of acquisition, the Amun priests now controlled two-thirds of all the temple lands in Egypt and 90% of all Egypt's ships, along with mountains of gold. On top of that, they were the chief prophets and interpreters of the god Amun-Ra's will, wielding a great deal of influence over the kings and their decisions. Over the last centuries, they had changed the rules of the priesthood so that they could pass their positions on to their sons, essentially becoming a kind of feudal royalty in the baking hot lands of Upper Egypt. One inscription on the tomb of a high priest named Nebwen-Eneph describes the power of this new hereditary role. You are now high priest of Amun. His treasury and his granary are under your seal. You are chief executive of his temple and every foundation of his is under your authority. The house of Hathor, lady of Denderah, shall now be under the authority of your son as heir to the offices of your forefathers, the position which you have occupied hitherto. Soon, the high priests in Thebes became the de facto rulers of Upper Egypt, even having themselves buried in grand tombs and commanding their own armies. In many ways, the pharaoh had become something of an irrelevance, and perhaps for that reason, there would not be a Ramses XII. With the death of Ramses XI, the Egyptian New Kingdom finally fractured. Less than 80 years after the victorious battle with the Sea Peoples, Egypt would never regain its former power. For the next four centuries, Egypt's influence would undergo a steady but unstoppable decline. One text written around this time is called The Tale of Wenamun. It describes an Egyptian diplomat who travels to the north to collect some cedar wood as tribute from the Phoenician city of Byblos. But while there, he finds that the name of the pharaoh no longer holds the kind of sway it used to. Wenamun is robbed on his journey and appeals to the ruler of Byblos for help. That morning when I had risen, I went to where the prince was and said to him, I've been robbed in your harbor. Now you are the prince of this land. You are the one who controls it. Search for my money. Indeed, the money belongs to Amun-Ra, king of gods, lord of the lands. He said to me, are you serious? Are you joking? Indeed, I do not understand the demand you make to me. To make matters worse, the king of Byblos refuses to pay the tribute of cedar wood that the pharaoh demands. Whether this story relates a true event or is simply a piece of literature, historians aren't sure. But either way, it points to the much-reduced state of Egypt's standing in the world, something that had clearly become common knowledge. The 21st dynasty that ruled from the northern Nile Delta through much of the 8th century BC were even descended from Libyan invaders, peoples from along the North African coast to the west. While the earliest of these Libyan pharaohs adopted classical Egyptian names, by the 22nd and 23rd dynasties, they reverted to giving their children more ethnically Libyan names, and even wearing Libyan feathered headdresses to underline their identity. Still, these Libyan kings were an unruly bunch who held close to their old tribal loyalties and were frequently distracted by warring amongst themselves and their own lords and generals. Meanwhile, the high priests of Amun continued to rule southern Egypt from Thebes. But even further to the south in the lands of Nubia, another power was rising. This was the Nubian kingdom of Cush.
As one of the two main African kingdoms to the south of Egypt, Kush was located at the fourth cataract of the Nile, around the region of Sudan today. For centuries now, this Nubian kingdom had been crushed beneath the boot of Egypt. Repeated expeditions up the Nile had seen Egyptian armies stamp out any sign of a powerful rival appearing in East Africa. But now, with the new kingdom of Egypt fractured and the Libyan kings ruling it in the north fighting amongst themselves, the Kushites were free to build their own power base. During Egypt's many attempts to invade and hold on to the lands in Nubia, Egypt had left a number of powerful fortresses to the Kushites. One of these had even become the capital of Kush, the city of Napata. But the Egyptians had also left behind something else, that is, their religion. The upper classes in Kush had long adopted Egyptian gods and forms of worship. Kushite rulers even referred to themselves as the son of Amun. When Herodotus traveled down the Nile in the following centuries, he described this region which he knew as Ethiopia. Above Elephantine, the country now begins to be inhabited by Ethiopians and half the people of the island are Ethiopians and half Egyptians. Near to the island is a great lake on the shores of which dwell nomad Ethiopians. The people of the place worship no other gods but Amun and Osiris. These they greatly honor and they have a place of divination sacred to Amun. While Egypt had stopped building pyramids more than a thousand years earlier, Kushite kings had taken up the building of pyramids of their own in classic Egyptian style. In some ways, Kush had become more Egyptian than the Egyptians. The kingdom was becoming wealthy too, its economy boosted by the Nubian gold mines it controlled and trade with sub-Saharan Africa. This wealth soon led to a powerful army. One king of Kush named Kashta would seize upon the opportunity that the situation afforded. While the Libyan kings of Egypt squabbled and fought among themselves, Kashta worked to gain influence over the high priests of Thebes. Eventually, he had his own daughter appointed to the powerful title of God's Wife of Amun in the great temple of Thebes. Once she was in that position, she moved to consolidate her power and claimed Thebes and all Upper Egypt for her father's kingdom of Kush. The Libyan kings in the Nile Delta, distracted by their civil wars, did nothing to stop them. Upper Egypt was now ruled by Nubians. When the Kushite king Kashta died, his son Pieh inherited what was now the Kushite Empire. Sometime around the 720s BC, King Pieh marched his Nubian armies down the Nile and conquered the fractious states of Lower Egypt. Pieh was clearly pragmatic in his approach and allowed any local governors to stay in their positions so long as they swore allegiance to him. A victory stele that he carved records his victories which he dedicates to the old Egyptian gods. Hear what I have done in exceeding the ancestors. I am the king, the representation of God, who issued from the womb marked as ruler, who is feared by those greater than he, whose father knew and whose mother perceived even in the egg that he would be ruler, beloved of the gods, the son of Ra, beloved of Amun. His son Shebitku solidified these conquests and united Egypt once more. For the next century, Egypt would be ruled by the 25th Dynasty, the Nubian pharaohs. Over the decades that followed, these Nubian rulers showed an enthusiastic adoption of Egyptian culture. They used the Egyptian language, gave each other
other Egyptian names and worshipped the Egyptian gods with apparent devotion. They even embarked on an enthusiastic program of pyramid building in Nubia, the first that the region had seen in centuries, if nothing quite like on the grand scale of the old kingdom. But this flourishing of Egyptian culture would not last long. That's because to the north, a power had finally risen that would eclipse the Egyptian empire for good. That was the empire of Assyria. As we saw in our 13th episode, Assyria had arisen in the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia, and by the 7th century was perhaps the most powerful empire on earth. They routinely amassed armies of more than a hundred thousand soldiers, and under the reign of the paranoid king Esarhaddon, they were now pressing their power far along the Mediterranean coast. Soon, they dreamed of bringing it to the banks of the Nile itself. The Nubian pharaoh who would face them was a man named Taharqa. Taharqa was the fifth king of the Nubian 25th dynasty, and he was clearly proud of his heritage and his skin color. He made sure that statues he commissioned were carved from hard black granite, polished smooth. He had come to Egypt as a young prince and had been chosen to rule after the death of the previous pharaoh, as he writes in one inscription. I was brought from Nubia among the royal brothers that his majesty had brought. As I was with him, he liked me more than all his brothers and his children, so that he distinguished me. I won the heart of all the nobles and was loved by all. It was only after the royal hawk had flown to heaven that I received the crown in Memphis. Curiously, Taharqa was also a believer in the benefits of long-distance running and insisted that all his soldiers engaged in nighttime marathon practices. The king himself was on horseback to see his army running when he exercised with them on the desert behind Memphis in the ninth hour of the night. They reached the great lake at the hour of sunrise and they returned to the residence in the third hour of the day. This extreme stamina would serve them well, and he would engage in successful assaults on Libyan positions across the desert and capture territory in Palestine. Throughout his reign, Taharqa was lucky. A series of exceptional Nile floods led to a period of abundant crops. Funds were clearly so forthcoming that he donated large amounts of gold to the temple of Amun and restored several religious centers, as one of his inscriptions boasts. As his majesty is the one who loves the god, he spends the day and lies by night seeking what is useful to the gods, building their temples fallen into decay, giving birth to their structures as in the primeval times, building their storehouses, endowing altars, presenting them with offerings of fine gold, silver, copper. Now, the heart of his majesty is satisfied with doing what is beneficent to them every day. This land is inundated in his time as it was in the time of the lord of all, every man sleeping until dawn and never saying, oh, I wish I had. Egypt was now of a size and stability that it hadn't seen since the collapse of the New Kingdom almost 400 years earlier. It must have looked like the dawn of a new era of prosperity, but this luck was not to last. In the year 674 BC, in Taharqa's 17th year on the throne, news came of a terrifying army approaching from the north. This horde belonged to King Esarhaddon of Assyria. Few foes had ever beaten the Assyrians on the battlefield, and fear must have spread up and down the Nile. But somehow, against the odds, Taharqa
was able to repel this force. The later Greek historian Herodotus records a fantastical story in which the invading Assyrian army was attacked by a horde of nighttime pests. When the road comes into Egypt, there, enemies came, and during the night were overrun by a horde of field mice that gnawed quivers and bows and the handles of shields, with the result that many were killed, fleeing unarmed the next day. For this reason, to this day, a statue to the Egyptian king stands in a temple with a mouse in his hand. What exactly this account records is difficult to tell. Perhaps it was an outbreak of plague among the Assyrian army that forced them to return home. Perhaps it was even a daring nighttime ambush by Taharqa's men, conditioned as they were to run long distances in the middle of the night, strike, and then disappear into the darkness. With their camp smashed and their army in disarray, the Assyrian army would have been pursued by Egyptian chariots right back to their borders. But we may never know. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Assyrian sources make no mention of what must have been a humiliating defeat. The sting of this embarrassment was clearly sufficient that three years later, King Esarhaddon amassed an even larger Assyrian army and marched back to Egypt. This time, there was no standing in its way. The Assyrians flooded into the Nile Delta and Taharqa fled from Memphis and into the south. The Assyrian advance was so speedy that the pharaoh was not able to evacuate his family when he left the city. Esarhaddon's troops took Memphis and the Assyrian king wrote the following gloating inscription about his cattle, his sheep. In countless numbers, I carried off to Assyria. The root of Cush I tore up out of Egypt, and not one therein escaped to submit to me. Over all of Egypt, I appointed a new kings, viceroys, governors, commandants, overseers, and scribes. My royal tribute and tax, yearly without ceasing, I imposed upon them. But if Esarhaddon had hoped to easily absorb Egypt into his empire, he was mistaken. Just a year later, the Nubian king Taharqa reappeared in the south, reinforced with troops from the kingdom of Cush. Numerous governors that Esarhaddon had installed immediately reverted their loyalties, and the whole Assyrian conquest looked like it might be undone. Enraged, King Esarhaddon marched back to Egypt to crush this rebel king. But his health failed on the journey, and he died in the city of Haram without reaching Egypt. Esarhaddon's son who took the throne was the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal. Virtually his first act as king was to gather an army and march to the rebellious province of Egypt to finish what his father had started. Ashurbanipal easily overwhelmed the now weakened Egyptian forces, recaptured Memphis, and in 663 BC, returned again to crush another round of rebellions. This time, he marched south up the Nile River and bore down on the ancient capital of Thebes. By that time, the Nubian king Taharqa had died and his nephew Tantamani sat on the precarious throne of Egypt. Tantamani met the Assyrians in battle, but he was defeated, and with him the last of Egypt's hope would die. The Assyrian army now rounded on the defenceless city of Thebes. Ashurbanipal records what happened next on one
carved cylinder. This city, the whole of it, I conquered it with the help of Ashur and Ishtar. Silver, gold, precious stones, all the wealth of the palace. Rich cloth, precious linen, great horses, supervising men and women, two obelisks of splendid electrum, weighing 2,500 talents. The doors of the temples, I tore from their bases and carried them off to Assyria. With this weighty booty, I left Thebes. Against Egypt and Cush, I have lifted my spear and shown my power. The Assyrian Sack of Thebes was the symbolic end of Egyptian power. Though Assyria would not hold Egypt for long and would itself collapse within only about 50 years, Egyptian esteem would never truly recover. A century later, Egypt was conquered by the Persian Achaemenid Empire, and in 343 BC, it was conquered again by the Macedonian forces of Alexander the Great. When Alexander's empire collapsed, Egypt would be left in the hands of one of his ex-generals, Ptolemy Soter. For the next three centuries, Egypt would be ruled by his Greek Ptolemaic dynasty, who spoke Greek and mostly refused to learn the native Egyptian language. These Ptolemies were still in power when the tide of Roman expansion swept across North Africa and finally over Egypt. The last independent ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt had a name that in Greek meant glory of her father, from kleos meaning glory and patra meaning father. Her name was Cleopatra. It's unclear if Cleopatra had any Egyptian ancestry as her mother is unknown, but she did at least make an effort to learn Egyptian, as Plutarch remembers. It was a pleasure merely to hear the sound of her voice with which, like an instrument of many strings, she could pass from one language to another, so that there were few of the barbarian nations that she answered by an interpreter. To most of them, she spoke herself, as to the Ethiopians, Hebrews, Arabians, Syrians, Parthians, and many others, whose language she had learned, which was all the more surprising because most of the kings, her predecessors, scarcely gave themselves the trouble to acquire the Egyptian tongue. When Rome finally invaded and occupied Egypt, Cleopatra apparently committed suicide, most likely by drinking poison or scratching herself with a needle dipped in toxin. The more florid and famous rendition of her using a venomous snake to kill herself was suggested by some ancient writers, and whether true or not, has proved irresistible to generations of poets, including most famously, William Shakespeare. With her death in August of the year 30 BC, the final vestige of independent Egyptian power died too. On the day of her death, Cleopatra stood at the height of more than 3,000 years of Egyptian history. To her, the Great Pyramid of Giza was now more than 2,500 years old, meaning that Cleopatra lived closer to our time than she did to the building of the Great Pyramid by more than 500 years. As Egypt came under ever more foreign influence, its ancient culture gradually underwent a transformation. Over the following centuries, as the Greek alphabet became more prominent, the knowledge of how to read hieroglyphics was slowly lost, as one medieval Arab visitor records. I asked why the inscriptions which cover the pyramids and the temples were indecipherable. He answered, since the learned men and those who use this writing have disappeared, and Egypt has been occupied by a succession of
foreign peoples, the Greek alphabet and thus they lost the understanding of the writing of their ancestors. The last known hieroglyphic inscription was written in the year 394 AD at the temple of Philae, built on an island near the cataract of the Nile at Aswan. By then, the now Christianized Roman Empire had banned the worship of pagan gods in Egypt's temples. But this religious site was just outside of Rome's borders, and so worship of the ancient gods continued here in the last of Egypt's great temples. Here, the names of Ra and Ptah, Anubis and Hathor, Amun and Bastet, Seth and Horus would still be spoken and sung, the incense still burned, the cats still fed, the offerings still given. But this island temple was increasingly isolated, surrounded by the crashing waters of a fast-changing world. The last hieroglyphic inscription records the mournful wish of one scribe named Nesmet-er-Akem, wishing that his inscription would endure forever, just like the carvings of his long-dead ancestors. Before Mandulis, son of Horus, by the hand of Nesmet-er-Akem, son of Nesmeta, the second priest of Isis for all time and eternity, word spoken by Mandulis, lord of the Abbaton, great god. As the last ever inscription of its kind, in some ways, he got his wish. But it's likely that by the time he chipped this message into the temple wall, few people alive would know how to read it. As far as we know, the art of the hieroglyph died with him. The temple was finally closed at some point in the 530s by the Byzantine emperor Justinian, and it was converted into a Christian church to Saint Stephen. The age of ancient Egypt had well and truly come to an end. Some 1400 years later, in the year 1818, the romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley would enter into a friendly competition with his friend, the poet Horace Smith. They had both read in a London newspaper about the coming arrival in the British Museum of a remarkable fragment of a statue brought by ship from the Ramessaeum mortuary temple in Thebes in Upper Egypt. It was the head and torso of a statue of Egypt's greatest pharaoh, the hero of the Battle of Kadesh, Ramesses II. The statue was one of a pair that had stood at the doorway of his temple. European colonial powers had long been hungering after that fragment of statue. Napoleon Bonaparte had even tried to remove it during his time in Egypt in 1798, but he found its bulk of black diorite too heavy to shift. Now, with wooden rollers and hundreds of workmen pulling ropes, the British team hauled the statue to the banks of the Nile, where it was transported down the river and on to London. After reading about this statue, Smith and Shelley agreed to a wager. They would each write a poem inspired by it and they would base their work on an extract from the writings of the Greek historian Diodorus of Sicily, who had once visited Ramesses II's temple in Thebes. Unfortunately for Horace Smith, history has decisively concluded their competition as his poem is little remembered. But Shelley's poem has become a classic, one of the greatest and most well-known sonnets in the English language. Titled Ozymandias, it is a poem that has come to stand as an emblem of the vainglorious pride of rulers, the inevitable downfall of tyrants, the awe-inspiring power of time, and the transience of all things.
I met a traveller from an antique land, who said, Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand, half sunk, a shattered visage lies, Whose frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command Tell that its sculptor well those passions read, Which yet survive stamped on those lifeless things The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed. And on the pedestal these words appear, My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings! Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare, The lone and level sands stretch far away. On the tomb wall of a pharaoh in Teff of the Middle Kingdom is a piece of literature known as the Harper's Song. Written in Egyptian hieroglyphics, it was a song designed to be sung at funerals and is more than 4,200 years old. At the time of writing his poem Ozymandias, Percy Bysshe Shelley could not have known about this piece of ancient literature, since hieroglyphics would not be conclusively deciphered for several more years. But across the gulf of four millennia, he and the unknown author of this song both describe a human emotion that is all too familiar, the deep sense of awe and melancholy we feel when we look at ruined places, at the crumbling palaces of long-fallen emperors, at the tombs of kings whose age has passed into dust. As you listen, imagine the vast gulf of time that separates our world from theirs. Imagine the sadness of watching your language forgotten and your cities crumbled. Imagine the tombs of ancient kings lying opened and robbed, the fallen pillars of emptied temples half-buried in the sand which shift and roll over the stones as the great disk of the sun sets red and blazing for a final time on the empire of Egypt. One generation passes, another stays behind. Such has it been since the men of ancient times. The gods of long ago rest in their pyramids, and yet the great and blessed likewise lie buried in their tombs. Yet those who built great mansions, their places are no more. What has become of them all? I have heard their words retold time and again. But where are their dwellings now? Their walls are in ruins and their places are no more, like something that has never been. There is no return for them, to explain their present state of being, to say how it is with them, to gentle our hearts until we make our journey to the place where they have gone. So follow your heart and your happiness, conduct your affairs on earth as your heart dictates. For that day of mourning will surely come for you. So spend your days joyfully, and do not grow weary of living. No man takes his things with him, and none who go can ever come back again.

Joe Rogan podcast, check it out! The Joe Rogan Experience. Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! Hello, Mark. Hello. Good to see you. Thanks for having me back. My pleasure. Good to see you. Well, the world's still functional. It's amazing. Yeah, amazing. We wanted to talk, you wanted to talk about the post-election sort of a wrap-up. Yeah. Sort of where we're standing. Are you happy? I'm happy. It was a weird one. Mourning in America. That was one of the first times ever I felt hopeful after an election. Like you should have seen the green room at the comedy club. Everybody was like, yes. Yes. Whoo. So my theory is the timeline, like in a science fiction movie, the timeline has split twice in the last like nine months. What was the first split? That was when Trump got shot. Oh. Yeah. And there was that moment where the world was going to head in two totally different directions. Right. If he got hit. Yeah. It was the most conspicuous display of physical bravery I've ever seen. Right. Afterwards. In that moment. Exactly. Yeah. And it could have gone, you know, horrifically badly for the entire world after that. So that was timeline split number one. So that other timeline is out there somewhere. Yeah. And I don't want to visit it. Boy, imagine being stuck there. What kind of horrible karma. No. I mean, that's a totalitarian dystopian nightmare. That's the bad place. Yeah. And then timeline split again on election day. I know you fancy a good conspiracy theory. Yes. But that gentleman being able to pull off what he did and, you know, the way it happened, the way it all went down is it's a Lee Harvey Oswald 2.0. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Clearly. Yeah. The shooter. Yeah. That we still don't know anything. There's no call for disclosure. Yeah. There's no call for a press conference. There's no toxicology report. The toxicology report had to have been done. Yeah. Wouldn't you want to know, like, what kind of stuff this kid is on that made him want to do that or if anything? Yeah. So my theory is it's almost as if the people want us to think it's a conspiracy. Like, it's almost like the whole thing is almost orchestrated. Like, it's just, it's so strange. You know, this is like the rapid cremation. Like, the whole thing was just completely bizarre. And then you're exactly right. Like, no hearings, no nothing. Now, having said that, I expect that this will change. Right. So, you know. Do you think they're going to do a dive into what happened? I mean, I would. I don't know if they will, but, you know, I certainly would if I was in a position to do that. I wonder what they can actually find. I mean, I don't know if they wanted it to be a conspiracy that people talked about or if that's simply the best way to pull it off. Yeah. Or it's just, yeah. Or it's just, you know, as we saw, I think, in the hearing afterwards, maybe just a systemic collapse of confidence. There's also a confidence in the fact that the news timeline today is so rapid. When things are relevant and people are paying attention to them, you have a couple of days. Yeah. Even with an assassination attempt on a former president. Yeah. Where people were murdered. Yeah. And there's, it's in and out. Yeah, that's right. I think it's exactly, I think the news cycle now is like a two to three day social media firestorm. And we just cycle from one to the next. Yeah. And we have the memory of Goldfish and, right, you know, things that would have been error defining just come and go with astonishing speed and shock. By the way, I should say, I don't think there was, I doubt there was a conspiracy. I don't think anything's possible. I think it's just, we have a confidence collapse. And I think we saw that on display when the director at the time, you know, testified. Well, there's all the elements that it could have been a conspiracy. It could have, but this is kind of the thing, which is just like, it also could have been systemic confidence collapse. And then it's like, okay, would it be better off for the institute, you know, if it looks like a conspiracy, right? Yeah. Like, you know, which world, okay, two timelines. Which world would you rather live in? The one with the conspiracies or the one with just like incompetence everywhere? Well, I think you have both simultaneously. I don't think it's binary. Right. I think there's incompetence everywhere and conspiracies are legitimate. They're real. Yeah. And that one seems like conspiracy. The fact that his house was professionally scrubbed, there's no social media record of this kid online. There's no nothing. He's the only kid of his generation who's that fired up about politics to have no online footprint. Like, it just doesn't make any sense. And he's a registered Republican. Like, the whole thing is like, so weird. And he was like a bad shooter and then he became a great shooter. Well, he definitely trained. Yeah, right. Like, you could train someone to become a good shooter. This is all you have to do. Don't move and do that. Right. Get all your mechanics in place. Right. Understand technique and positioning, breathing. It's not like the most complicated thing from a prone position. Right. But the fact that he chose to use iron sights I thought was weird too. Yeah. There's a lot of weirdness to it. Yeah. You know, from 140 yards with a scope, that is an easy shot. Yeah. Well, then he could just like wander up. That's the different timeline. The different timeline is he has a scope and that's it. Okay. All right. Right. That would have. And Trump's dead. Yep. And then, boy. Yep. Boy, do we live in a crazy world then. Yeah. Completely bizarre. I mean, what does the streets look like right now? Yeah. What kind of like protests and riots and- 
You think January 6th was not if they had killed Trump that would be January 6th on steroids everywhere Yeah, that's right. And we would we would experience it. I mean, you know, I don't know when I was a kid my High school high school history teacher got us a bootleg copy of this. There's a printer film You know, it's like what a gangster high school. He was actually pretty focused on that He's really loved the Kennedy assassination So we spent a lot of time on that and you know You know, you kind of watch it frame by frame and you can kind of see what's happening with this lots of questions But like when things like that happen, you know today it's gonna be in high-definition 4k ultra. It's rounds on forever Yeah, right playing out in real time forever. And so like I yeah, I very much don't want to live in the world Where those things happen? Well, we are very fortunate. I mean, I like I said after the election I was like wow voting works Voting works that's nice like they don't have the system completely rigged and then but they kind of Tried to rig it at least with the media the where the real rigging in the 2020 elections me you didn't cast all your conspiracies upon it was in terms of like mail-in ballots and all this jazz but the real rigging was the collusion between Social media companies and the government to suppress information that would have altered the effect of the election. That's legitimate. Oh, yeah for sure Yeah, that was like direct interference and it was in aided and abetted by a lot of former, you know intelligence officials Yeah, and by the current administration, you know tons of pressure on censorship coming from this, you know The current administration and all their kind of arms of the censorship apparatus You have your hands in the tech community of your fingers and all that jazz like what was the general attitude? About all that stuff when it was revealed. How did how did people you know, how did your peers respond to that? I think anybody in social media the internet companies knew it. So it was pretty widely understood I mean look there's nothing that happened at Twitter in the Twitter files It wasn't happening all the all the other companies, right? So it's a it's a consistent pattern if you got the YouTube files They would look exactly the same and of course, we should get the YouTube file Sure, right and now we probably probably will now with you know, this new administration is probably gonna carve all this stuff open But yeah, no, look it was a pattern and then look, you know The companies bear a lot of responsibility and the people in the companies, you know made a lot of I think bad judgment calls But the government like the Biden White House was directly exerting censorship pressure on American companies to censor American citizens Which I think by the way is just flatly illegal like I think it's actually subject to criminal charges Like I think there are people with criminal liability who were involved in this so there was that there were also members of Congress doing the same thing which is also illegal and Then there was a lot of funding of outside third-party groups that were that were bringing a lot of pressure down on censorship Yeah, and just an example that is there's a unit at Stanford, you know right next door, you know to us that you know It was the internet censorship unit that was funded by the US government And exerted tremendous pressure on the companies to censor and it was it was very effective at doing so Does it smell like sulfur when you walk those halls? It is very dark and grim This whole thing is very bad. And so Oh, yeah Stanford Stanford by the way Another unit like that at Harvard, you know a bunch of universities got pulled into this a lot of NGOs and nonprofits got pulled into this and so the Twitter file showed us kind of the basic roadmap and then there's this thing called the weaponization committee that Congressman Jordan is running that has also revealed a lot of this But I I would imagine the new Trump administration is going to come in and carve all that wide open and I know that there Are people in you know being appointed to senior positions who are very determined to do that This episode is brought to you by blinds.com You probably think custom window coverings are just to keep the neighbors from staring in right?

It's like more than a hundred million dollars, right? Yeah, there's just there's extensive government funding of politically oriented NGOs. Yeah
Yeah. NGO is one of those great terms, like non-governmental organization, all right, like what the hell is that? Right. What is that? Tell me. I don't know. Well, it's sort of a charity. Sort of. Sort of. But most of the time, it's a political entity. It's an entity with a political agenda. But then it's funded by the government in a very large percentage of cases, including the NGOs and the censorship complex, like the government grants, National Science Foundation grants, like direct State Department grants, right, direct money. And then, okay, now you've got an NGO funded by the government. Well, that's not an NGO. That's a geo. Right. Right. And then you've got a conspiracy, like with censorship, then you have a conspiracy because you've got government officials using government money to fund what look like private organizations that aren't. And then what happens is the government outsources to these NGOs the things that it's not legally allowed to do. Like what? Like censorship. Oh, okay. Like violation of First Amendment rights. Right. So what they always say is the First Amendment only applies to the government. The First Amendment says the government cannot censor American citizens. And so what they do is if you want to censor American citizens in the government, if you're smart, you don't do that. What you do is you fund an outside organization and then you have them do it. Boy. Right. And that's what's been happening. Right. And that's like hiring a hitman. Like it's not okay to murder someone, but you can hire someone to murder someone and then you're clean. Yeah. And if you want to solve a murder, it's not enough to find out who the hitman was. You have to find out who paid the hitman. Right. Of course. You want to work your way up the chain. You want to get your hands into the White House. The best defense the companies have is that a lot of this happened under coercion. Right. Because when the government puts pressure on you, like it might be a phone call. It might be a letter. It might be the threat of an investigation. It might be a subpoena. It could take many forms. But when the government does that, it carries, you know, that's a very powerful message. Right. It's like a message from a mob boss. Right. Right. It's like, don't you want to do me a favor? Right. It's like, you know, yes, Mr. Gambino, I do. Right. Like I like my corner store. I'd like it to not catch on fire tonight. Yeah. There's this overwhelming hammer blow of pressure that comes in. And by the way, even when the government doesn't talk to you directly, if they're funding the organization that is talking to you, then it's very clear what's happening. And so you come under incredible pressure. And so the whole kind of chain, this whole chain of governments, activists, universities and companies was corrupted. And then on top of that, people in the companies in a lot of cases made a lot of decisions that I think they're probably increasingly starting to regret. What was confusing to me was that the government spent so much money on these activist groups during the election. And I didn't understand what purpose that would serve. What function would it serve to spend all this money on these activist groups that already support you, supposedly? Are you bribing them to support you? Are you paying them to go on talk shows and consistently repeat the government's message, the current administration's message? What would be the function of that? So I think in some cases it's just pay to play, right? So for example, we know that Kamala's campaign paid certain on her personalities, you know, and then there were, you know, it's your point. People are very supportive of Kamala, who then gave her, you know, interviews that went really well. And so I think in some cases you just have straight pay to play. That's just how that system works. It's just expected. And then I think you have other organizations like these NGOs and others, activist groups where they're actually, you know, they actually do field activities, right? And so there's, you know, maybe there's a get out the vote component or there's, you know, social media influence downstream component or some other, you know, kind of field activity that's happening in support of the election. I just didn't think that they paid, like when it's still unclear whether or not celebrities got paid to endorse her, right? Have you... They've mixed it up because there's, like Oprah said, Oprah says her production company was paid to put on the production, but she was not paid for the interview. Yeah, whatever. But it was, you know, two, whatever, two million dollars. Two and a half million dollars. It was initially listed as one and it turned out it was 2.5. Right. Like if I have a production company and my production company gets paid $2.5 million to endorse Trump, and then I go, I didn't get any of that money. People are like, shut the fuck up because it's your company, what are you talking about? And also, how much does it cost to do an event? How does it cost $2.5 million to put on an event? Like are you feeding people gold sandwiches? Like what are you doing? Like how is that possible? Yeah, exactly. So, yeah. And then you can see the fact that it's deliberately obfuscated, of course, is a clue. I just thought the really bizarre one was the allegations, and I'd say unsubstantiated allegations. It's been alleged that Beyonce got $10 million and Lizzo got $3 million, Eminem got $1.8 million. Like, really? Yeah. I think if you just like published all these numbers, these celebrities would all get so mad at each other. Oh, sure they are. Then you would learn everything. Eminem got short. He got short. Right, right, right. Lizzo's furious right now, right? Yeah. Lizzo's probably listening to this right now being like, what? Well, I wonder if Lizzo's like, I didn't get shit. I would say it, but why haven't they said it? Like Beyonce has been mum about the whole thing. I think I would probably say, like, I didn't get any money to do that.
Was a weird one too because a lot of people thought Beyonce was gonna do a concert, right? And she just went out there and talked and everybody's like what the fuck because they all came to see a free Beyonce concert Yes, and then she just said I want to support Kamala Harris and everybody's like good good Now if you like it, then you should have put a ring on it Come on we love your songs. Yes. That's what we're here for. Yes. I just didn't think that it was even possible that a I Didn't think a candidate would ever pay for an endorsement. Yeah, I mean the fact that it was even alleged. Yeah. Yeah Well, you know and then there's of course there's there's the even stinkier version arguably Which is all that all the social media influencer campaigns now, there's you know, tremendous amount of payola that's for sure right because I know people personally who are approached multiple times and Offered a substantial amount of money to post things in support of Harris Yeah, and like I'm pro-capitalism and I'm happy for them if they get paid but like maybe we should know Yeah, that seems like something you should absolutely have to disclose It should be like like say if I was gonna do an ad for you know Whatever a certain coffee company Black Rifle coffee and I did it on my Instagram. I'd have to say ad I have to say this is an ad. It's a paid ad. Yeah, and that's part of the thing. Yeah, you know Yeah, unless it's your company. Yep. Like you're supposed to say they're paying me to do this. Yeah. Yeah Well, you know look the good news with these is we learn each cycle We learn a lot about how politics works. We learn about a lot about how fake it is We learn a lot about the things we put up with for a very long time I mean everybody's always like freaked out by like whatever the new guy does but like this real scandal in most cases I think it's just the way the system already works. It's a sneaky system Yeah, well another fascinating aspect of the system that we learned out this time around is the Uncontrolled aspect of it like what Trump called earned media, right was much more powerful than anything else The uncontrolled version of it like one of the things that unfortunately for them Mass media or corporate media has done is they've diminished their credibility so much so much So that like Joy Reid was on TV today talking about saying that Trump was gonna shoot protesters and just wild unsubstantiated crazy shit and The more they do stuff like that the more that they say things like that the more it diminishes their impact and the more it Drives people to independent media sources. Yeah, I'm sure you've seen the ratings collapse that they've been you know They're down to like they're down to like MSNBC's down to like 50,000 people in the 18 to 20 18 to 49 demo That is so wild which is tiny. It's so crazy. It's really tiny So I think that's happening the Gallup organization has done polls on trust in institutions including, you know Media for the last 60 years. It's been a steady slide down and in the last, you know, four years. It's fallen off a cliff I think it's real. Oh, there's another study that came out. The kids are not watching a lot less TV Kids are just giving up on TV Yeah, they're just you know, they're on YouTube and tick-tock and Instagram and other things and so like I I think it's tipping a question I've been asking myself is when when will the actual, you know that famously 1960 was the first television election, right? You know sort of legend has it because the one where the televised debate really mattered and if you saw the televised debate you saw Confident Kennedy and nervous Nixon and if you heard right you experience something different and handsomeness and handsomeness effect and vitality Yeah health. Yeah, right and all these things sort of positive positive spirit positive energy I'm actually not this this might be of have been the first internet election or maybe we actually haven't had it yet Like I feel like we're really close to the first internet election, but maybe it's not all the way there. This is it I think this there's an argument that this is it right and that you know, all the you know All the stuff especially in the last six months all the podcasts obvious in your show played a big role but like I think there's a real if you're gonna run in 28 like I think there's like a fully internet native way to run these campaigns that might literally involve like zero television advertising and maybe you don't even need to raise that money and maybe you to Your point if you have the right message, maybe you just go straight direct. Yeah, I might be a completely different way to do this I think that's the only way now and I think if you do pay people It's not gonna have the same impact, you know I think these call her daddy shows and all these different shows that she went on I mean, I'm sure they had an impact but I think that in the future I'm sure they're scrambling to try to create their own version of this show This is one thing that keeps coming up like we need our own Joe Rogan, right, but they had me Number one they had you number one. They had you They had you in the drove you away is that number one number but they also have you know, ABC NBC CBS CNN, right? But that doesn't work anymore. I know that's like, you know, like you're using smoke signals and everybody else has a cell phone Yeah, it doesn't work. Yeah, that's right. That's right. It's just it's it's a bizarre time It's really interesting though. Like as you said like we're in a great timeline and I think It's a fascinating timeline too because there's so much uncertainty and there's so much right we are at the verge of a
AI, you know, open AI, you know, Altman has said now that he thinks 2025 will be the year that AI becomes sentient, whatever that means, you know, artificial general intelligence will be will emerge. And who knows how that affects I've said publicly, and I'm kind of half joking that we need AI government. Yep. You know, it sounds crazy to say, but instead of having this like alpha chimpanzee that runs the tribe of humans, how about we have some like really logical fact based, you know, program that, you know, makes it like really reasonable and equitable in a way that we can all agree to, right? Let's govern things in that manner, right? So you can actually simulate this today, because you can go on these systems, shed GPT, or a lot of these others. And you can you can ask, you know, how should we handle issue x? How should this be? Yeah, we've done that, right? How should the Department of Energy do whatever nuclear policy or whatever. And what I find when I do that, as I discovered two things, number one, of course, these things are these things have the same problem, social media said, which is they're tremendously politically biased, and right, that's on purpose, and they need to fix that. And that's going to be a big topic in the next several years. But the other thing you learn is, if you can get through the political basically bias and censorship, if you can actually get to a discussion of the actual issue, it's you get very sophisticated answers. Yes, right. Very logical, very straightforward. And it will explain every aspect of the issue to you. And it'll take you through all the pros and cons. Yeah. And you know, I mean, it might be the way to go, which is so horrifying for people to think because everyone's worried about the terminators taking over the world. And like, if that's the first step, as we let them govern us, well, look, there's nothing stopping a politician from using this. There's nothing stopping a policymaker from using you know, as a tool, right? You start out at least you start out using it as a tool. There's nothing to prevent you like, for example, I think military commanders in the field are going to have basically AI battlefield assistance that are going to advise them on strategy tactics, yes, and how to win conflicts, and then it'll start to work its way up. And then they'll be doing you know, war planning. And then if you're a general, if you're, you know, a sergeant or a colonel or a general, it's going to just mean you perform better. Yeah. And so maybe there's like, you know, the sort of man-machine kind of symbiotic relationship. You could imagine that happening more in the policy process and in the political process. And there's also AI controlled jets, which are far superior. They did, Mike Baker was telling us about that. They did these simulated dogfights and the AI controlled jets won 100% of the time. Yeah. Over humans. Yeah. And there's a bunch of reasons for that. And part of it is just simply the speed of and so forth. But another big thing is if you don't have a human in the plane, you don't have the, they say the spam in the can, you don't have the, you know, you don't have the human body. Yeah. In the plane. You don't have to keep a human being alive, which means you can be a lot faster and you can move a lot more quickly. G-forces. Much higher G-forces. Yeah. And then there's no option for someone to go crazy. Yeah. That's also right. Yes, exactly. There's no human element, you know, which is a real element. Yeah. No, look, I think we're going to, it's going to be common to have like Mach 5 drone, you know, jet drones within, within a few years. And, you know, there'll be a fraction of the size of the current, you know, manned planes, which means you can have like a lot more of them. And so you kind of want to imagine, you know, a thousand of these things like coming over the horizon right at you. And it really changes. It's actually, I think it'd be very interesting. It really changes the fundamental equation of war in the following sense. Fundamentally in the past, the people who won wars are the people who had the most men and the most material. Right. Right. And you had the most soldiers and you needed the most equipment. And in this drone world that we're talking about, it's going to be the people with the most money and the best technology. Yeah. Right. And so, for example, small states, you know, small advanced states like Singapore will be able to punch way above their weight and then kind of large sort of economically or technologically backward states that normally would have won will now lose. And so it's going to, it's going to be a recalibration. And then it has the, the good news is you're not putting soldiers at risk, right? So you'll have a lot less, a lot less death. The bad news arguably is it'll be easier to get into conflicts because you're not putting soldiers at risk. So there's going to have to be a recalibration of like when you actually like lean into an attack. I'm sure you're aware of all this UAP disclosure jazz that you see on television. The more I look into it, the more I think at least a percentage of it, a healthy percentage of it is bullshit. And there's probably some government projects where they've developed some very sophisticated propulsion systems that they've applied to drones and that that's what these people are seeing. And this is one of the reasons why they continually have sightings over secured military spaces, like out in the Eastern seaboard, like there's areas over Virginia where they continually see them in San Diego, they see them off the coast of San Diego, where there's a place where you would test stuff like that. Yeah. Well, so of course, we know that that was the case for a very long time for sure from the 50s through the 80s, because the development of stealth was highly classified. And the SR-71 was brand new at one point. And so you had these like, you know, alien, you know. Do you pay attention to any of that stuff at all? Of course. Of course. A hundred percent. Yeah. And then, and then, and then by the way, we're not the only ones. And so I, you know, my speculation would be that some of the military based stuff is, you know, the Chinese doing something similar. And, you know, we got a glimpse into that with.
the balloon. Well, that one was goofy, though. They got shut down, but still, the fact that the Chinese are flying surveillance balloons over American territory, and they were able to slip through our early warning systems and just loiter above military bases, and take lots of imagery, and do whatever scans they do. Yeah. And literally, nothing was happening, and we didn't even know they were there most of the time. And so, I would just say, that's like a tip of the ... It feels like a tip of the iceberg kind of thing, where if they were doing that, there were probably other things going on. Well, I've read that someone had commented that similar things had happened during the Trump administration, but they didn't tell Trump, because they didn't want him to shoot them down. Interesting. For the record, I'm pro-shooting them down. Yeah. I think you should probably shoot them down. They're taking pictures and shit. They're nuts. There's not even people up there. Fucking shoot them down. Yeah. Yeah. What's the problem? Yes. Exactly. Yeah. Do you think there are any of those that are not of this world? I don't think there's any way to know from the outside. Have you ever pondered it, late at night, sitting on your porch, staring up at the sky? Of course. Racist. Number one, is there or not? And then, if it is, did it recently get here, or have they been here for a long time? Did they arrive 5,000 years ago? Tucker thinks they're demons and angels. I mean, demons and angels. Are demons and angels real? It's like, literally, probably not, but certainly, they're metaphorically real. And are there kind of shades of gray between literal and metaphorical? Well, the actions are certainly demonic and angelic. Right? Yeah, of course. Human beings, things that happen in the world are uplifting or horrific. Yeah. Evil people doing evil things are possessed. I mean, they're possessed by something. Right. Right. Like, something is going on. Right. And, like, you know, what's the dividing line between, you know, an actual supernatural force and some sort of psychological, sociological thing that's so overwhelming that it just takes control of people and drives them crazy? Like, you might as well call that a demon. Yeah. It's fascinating because, like, when you think of it from theological terms, like, when you think of it from a religious perspective, you know, people would apply, what would a demon do? What would angels do? What is the will of God and what is, like, the evils of the worst aspects of humanity? You would, you know, you could apply them to so many things in the world, but we're very reluctant to say that something is demonic, like, even though it's clearly demonic, like, it's clearly inaction. Like, this is what a demon would do. A demon would possess people to gun down children, you know, and, you know, use drones to shoot down a wedding party. A demon would do that. Right. Exactly. So, a friend of mine is a religious scholar. He teaches at Catholic University and he's a religious history scholar, and he says that medieval people would have had a...medieval people were psychologically better prepared for the era ahead of us with AI and robots and drones everywhere than we are because medieval people took it for granted that they lived in a world with higher powers, higher spirits, angels, demons, all kinds of supernatural entities. And it was just assumed to be true. And in the world we're heading into, you know, that we're arguably already in, you know, there are going to be these, you know, new forces, these new entities running around doing things. And, you know, we're going to just...we're going to struggle and we're going to, you know, we're going to catastrophize. We're going to conclude, you know, like, AI is the end of the world. The medievals would have said, oh, it's just another spirit, like, you know, it's just another kind of entity. Yeah. It's better than humans at some things, but so are angels. And so we're going to have to, like, change our mentality. We're almost going to have to become a little bit more medieval. We're going to have to open up our minds to the kinds of entities that we're dealing with. Wow. Yeah. Which also could help us actually deal with people. Like maybe there's an explanatory way to think about human behavior here that seems less rational but might actually be more rational. Well, you express yourself very brilliantly in describing the current state of woke ideology as a religion. That's right. And that the way you described it was brilliant because you were saying that it has all the elements, excommunication, adherence to a very strict doctrine, all these different aspects of it, saying things that everyone knows to be illogical and nonsensical, but you must repeat it. Right. You know, these things are indicative of people that are in cults or people that are a part of like a very, like a serious fundamental religion. Yeah. Well, I mean, of course, the big difference between woke and those traditional religions is woke has no concept of redemption. Right. It has no concept of forgiveness. Right. Which is a very evil religion. You do not want that to be the cornerstone of your religion, right? Yeah. It's also, well, it's ill-conceived, right? Yes. Because it's like immature. It's an immature religion. Yes. It's absolutist. It's inherently totalitarian. It has to be because it can permanently destroy people. Yeah. Woke also understands something that the Greeks understood, which is that being ostracized and being put to death are the same thing. And so when the Greeks sentenced somebody like Socrates to death, they gave them the option of just leaving. Really? Yes. Socrates could have just walked out and left. No kidding. But the reason that was considered equivalent sentences is because at that time, if you were not a citizen of a particular city, you would get killed in the next city. You'd be identified as the enemy.
Presumptively and killed and so there was no way to survive without being part of your community And and that's what the woke's figured out is you can do the same thing if you're able to like, you know Nail somebody on you know on charges of having done something, you know, unacceptably horrible Then you make them toxic and all of a sudden they can't you know, they can't have you sure You know people, you know, they lose friends. They lose family. Yeah, they can't get work You know before you know it like they're you know, living, you know, severely diminished damaged lives Some people then go on to kill themselves. I don't know if you've been paying attention at all to blue sky But I have multiple friends that have accounts on blue sky that are very sophisticated trolls and are Pushing like the woke agenda to a satirical point like to like parody Yeah But like on the edge where you're not quite sure they'll say enough real things that make sense and talk about their own anxieties and personal issues with stuff and then say Fucking ridiculous shit and it's Fascinating I bet it works. It does work. That's what's so terrifying It's like all the outcasts of Twitter all the people that were like, I can't take this a few of them will come back Which is wonderful. I love when they come back. I'm gone I'm gonna go to blue sky. Fuck you people like a bunch of them went to threads for a while Like Stephen King he went to threads came right back. They all come right back They can't the marketplace of ideas like okay You could go to like a fruit stand in the middle of the fucking desert and that's a marketplace Or you can go to the farmers market where everybody's there like, where are you gonna go? That's right You're gonna go to the farmers market. That's tons of people. It's a lot of fun. That's a lot of activity Yes, that fruit stands fucking barren and deserted. There's no one there. There's very few choices Yeah, yeah, it's not fun And it's win-win to have the most win-win to have the back on Twitter because it's good for them because they want to proselytize And so they need an audience. So they win and then we win because it's really really fun to dunk on them But it's also weird for them to not want any pushback at all Like don't it isn't the whole thing supposed to be about an exchange of ideas Like if you have a controversial idea and someone disagrees with it, don't you want to hear that position? I know I do I want to hear it. Even if I vehemently disagree with it. I want to hear it I want to know where how do you how's your brain work? How are you coming to these conclusions? What makes you think this way? Who are you? What do you like? I want to go on Instagram I want to look at your pictures. I want to see what you're up to. What are you doing? You know, yeah, we do you free time, you know, what are you complaining about? Yeah. Yeah, I want it's like it's a fascinating education on human psychology and To watch people express themselves publicly and then also be attacked publicly by strangers Which never happens in the real world it like at scale Yes The way it happens on social media and I think it's an amazing time for people to examine ideas If you can handle it, yeah, my favorite term is marketplace of idea. Yeah You could have a marketplace of ideas. It's just gonna be one idea All right, so blue sky is a marketplace of ideas. Sure. Yeah access the marketplace of ideas That final s makes a lot of difference. Yeah, right, but the thing about X's it really is diverse There's I follow tons of like kooky leftist progressive Nutbags that like have bizarre takes on everything Yeah, and they were a hundred percent convinced that Kamala Harris is gonna sweep all the swing states including, Iowa They were all in and I was like, this is wild. Yeah, like is that gonna happen? Are they right like this is crazy, but it's they were 100% convinced and it's it's fascinating to see all these different kinds of people to see the Charlie Kirk's and you know The the full-on left-wing kooks and see them all together, right? So what you need that? Yeah Look, so one of the ways I think to think about this is all new information is heretical By definition, right? So so anytime anybody has a new idea that it's a it's a threat to the existing power structure So all new ideas start as heresies And so if you don't have an environment that can tolerate heresies You're not gonna have new ideas and you're gonna end up with complete stagnation, right? If you have stagnation you're gonna go straight into decline Yeah, right and and I think this is that the aberrant nature. This is the timeline split I think that I think the last decade has just been like a really weird aberrant time where things have not been working like they should and and you know in 2015 Twitter called itself the free speech wing of the free speech party, right? And Ilan Ilan has not like Jake Ilan has restored it, right? He brought it back. He brought it back to something that everybody thought was completely normal ten years ago Yeah, and I think I hope this last ten years increasingly is just gonna feel like a bad dream Like I can't believe we tolerated the level of repression right and anger and you know emotional incontinence and you know Cancellation campaign emotional incontinence is a great term. Yes Diarrhea in your emotions just spraying rage in all directions And so I you know, I'm very at the moment at least very optimistic that there's a cultural change happening here That's even more profound than the political. I have a lot of respect and also sympathy for Jack Dorsey
I like him a lot as a human being. I think he's a brilliant guy, and I think he had very good intentions. But he was a part of a very large corporation, and he had an idea for a Wild West Twitter. He wanted to have two versions of Twitter. He wanted to have the Twitter that was pre-Elon, where there's moderation and you can't deadname someone and all that jazz. And then he wanted to have an additional Twitter that was essentially what X is now. And he just didn't have the ability to push that through with the board and the executives and all the people that were fully on board with woke ideology. Yeah. So the experience that people like Jack have had running these companies in the last decade has been, and I don't mean to let them off the hook for their decisions, but just the lived experience, as they say, of what these people's lives have been like is just daily pounding. Just every single day, it's like meteor strikes coming down from the sky, exploding around you, getting attacked from every conceivable direction, being called just incredibly horrible things, being attacked from many different directions. Well, he's already left Blue Sky. Well, yeah. So the irony of Jack is that Jack then created Blue Sky, which is kind of exactly the opposite of any way where he thought it. Oh, by the way, the new name for it, of course, is Blue Cry. Ah, I didn't know that. Exactly. Yeah. But he's also got, look, to his credit, he's still trying, and so he's got Nostr, which is another- What is it? It's called Nostr, N-O-S-T-R. Oh, okay. This is kind of new. It's actually his third. He's going to keep swinging. Full credit. He's going to keep swinging. And by the way, full credit, he supported Elon. Yes. It mixed up a little bit, but by and large, he's been very supportive and was very supportive at a key time. Well, I also found it fascinating that when there was any sort of a right-wing branch of that stuff, like Gab or any of these, they would immediately be infiltrated by bots as well, like my friends that troll on Blue Sky. But these are Nazis. These are Nazi bots. These are people that would just spew horrible hate. And then Gab would be labeled, oh, this is where the Nazis go. This is a right-wing psychopath social media app. Yeah. And I think, frankly, I think you get the same thing if you start out. I think if you start out overtly political on either side, I think that's what you end up with. Yes. And so that doesn't seem to be an effective route to market. It seems like you have to start from the beginning as a general purpose service, but you need to have some sense of the actual guardrails you're going to have around. And by the way, every social media service, internet service that ever works, there's always some content filters and restrictions because you can't have child porn, you can't have incitement to violence, you can't have terrorist recruitment. And even the First Amendment, there's like a dozen carve-outs that the Supreme Court has ruled on over time that are things like that, that you can't just say, I can't say, let's go join ISIS and let's go attack Washington. It's literally not allowed. So there's always some controls, but you need to have like a spine of steel if you're going to hold back the censorship pressure. And there's basically Substack, a company I'm involved in, is doing very well. I love Substack. Smaller than Twitter, but doing extremely well. Fantastic. And they've done a great job, I think, of holding the line on this stuff. Yes. And then obviously- And it's an amazing resource. There's so many brilliant people on Substack. I love Substack. I get a large percentage of my news from Substack. It's really good, and it's so valuable, and it's such a great place for people who are independent journalists and physicians and scientists to publish their ideas and actually get paid for it by the people who subscribe to it. I think it's fantastic. And there's lots of people on the far left and the far right. Yes. Right. So you actually have the full spread. When a far left person gets upset, somebody working in the New York Times is mad because they're not far left enough, they quit and they start Substack. And Substack welcomes them in, which is why they don't devolve into a gabber or something like that, because it really is a platform. It really does welcome all conversations. Well, it's also very difficult to subvert in that same way, because Substack is essays. You're reading people's essays and papers on things, and these are long form things that are very well, in a lot of cases, very well researched. And it's not the kind of thing you could just shit post on. There are comments, but it's just like they don't hold the weight that the actual article holds. Right. So my partners at work, they've observed that I tend to be able to inflame situations from time to time. I can tend to be provocative and get people really upset. And so the rule they've asked me to comply with is, I'm allowed to write essays, for example, in Substack, and I'm allowed to go on long form podcasts, but I'm not allowed to post. Really? Right. Exactly. You have rules. It's the rule. It's the rule. Now, by the way, I struggle against the rules, because I can't help myself from time to time. Why do they want you to have rules? Because otherwise I inflame people too much. I drive people too crazy. Do you do it on purpose? Sometimes. I mean, sometimes you have to. It's unintentional. Did you ever hear about when the entire country of India was mad at me? No! Oh, I spent one night with the entire country of India basically wanting to kill me. It was incredible. Oh my goodness. What happened? I mean, I was in a Twitter debate with somebody back when I was just posting freely on Twitter, and it was a debate about economics, and the topic of colonialism came up.
I made a comment in a long thread about colonialism, and it turns out the Indians are still extremely sensitive about the topic of colonialism, and I did not understand the mindset and the historical orientation, and I tripped a line. And I stayed up all night, and I went hyper-viral in every time zone in India. Every hour, there would be an entirely new activation. And I was like, front-page headline news, top-of-the-hour TV news, all the way across India. Wow. Yes, it was like a, I do not recommend this as an experience. By the way, I learned how many incredible Indian-American friends I have, because they all rallied to my side, and said, you know, Mark's not literally calling for the recolonization of India, like that was not actually. It was probably the language barrier as well, right? Language, and then just, my big one is just historical context. Americans have a different, we Americans experience history differently than almost everybody else. History for us is just like stuff that happened in the past that doesn't matter anymore, but a lot of other people around the world experience history as something that really still matters, like really matters to their life today. Yes. They just, they live in history more than we do. They have a deeper understanding of kind of how they got to where they were, and the things that happened to their parents and grandparents and ancestors. And so there's just, it's just, you know, I don't know if it's better or worse, it's just a different way of experiencing reality. Yeah. Anyway, I recommend learning that lesson not by enraging a billion people. I experienced a small version of that recently, because I said we shouldn't be using long range missiles on Russia and the Ukrainians, like, and Ukrainian bots, a bunch of people came after me. Because I was saying like the Biden administration, I was like, fuck these people. And then I think some people misconstrued that as fuck the Ukrainian people, which I absolutely was not saying. I was saying, fuck whoever in the last days of the presidencies decide to escalate this war, because it appears that that's what they've done. It appears that they're leaving Trump a giant mess, at the very least. So the good news is I am allowed to go on podcasts. I am allowed to. That's a good news. In the theory, it's your sub, bring it up though, because it's your sub stack thing. It's because it's basically, Mark, you need to explain yourself in long form. Yes. You can't just say a thing, exactly to your example, you can't just say a thing and have people extrapolate from it. Right. Because they'll extrapolate. It's not their fault, because you haven't, it's your fault, because you haven't explained it. Right. Right, and so if you write something long form, or if you go talk for three hours, at least you'll, the context will be there. And then if they want to get mad at you, that's fine. But you can point everybody to the transcript. And it's clear that that's not what you meant. Do you also think while you're writing how things could be misconstrued? So let me like do a really good job of being very clear about this. 100%. Yeah, you kind of have to. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, like I had Jimmy Corsetti on the other day, and he is an expert in ancient history and ancient civilizations. And we had these fascinating subjects. And one of them that came up was the Nazis and their fascination with the occult. And so you had to like clearly say, fuck Hitler, okay, can I be really clear? Fuck Hitler and fuck the Nazis, okay? I have not in any way. Okay, now that we're clear, let's talk about where the swastika came from. Fuck Hitler, did I say fuck Hitler? Let me say it again, fuck Hitler. But the swastika is this ancient symbol. And it's like talking about like why did the Nazis have this fascination with the occult and with ancient civilizations? And so we got into it, but it was like one of those things where it's like, all right, we're hitting the third rail, everybody get your rubber boots on. Let's save everybody here. Yeah, I've got a friend in the entertainment business who is quite left-wing, but really likes World War II documentaries. And so he'll be like, yeah, I saw this great documentary last night about Hitler. And I'm like, I bet you did. You can't even have a copy of Mein Kampf in your house. Oh, a student, this is actually one of the Stanford crazy stories. A student at Stanford was reported to the disciplinary board, the civil whatever disciplinary board for reading a copy of Mein Kampf in the quad. Oh my God, that's so crazy. Which is a book that's been, you know, assigned for 80 years to college kids to like understand who these people were and like how to not do that again. Yeah, that kid was like nearly brought up in charges and nearly expelled. So like, yeah, that's, yes, this is the world that I hope that we're leaving. Well, it's just an awful way to look at things. It's so awful to think that if you read about someone horrible, you support them. It's just so crazy. Like, well, how are we gonna study history? Yeah, right. And how are we gonna prevent bad things from happening again if we can't wrap our heads around why they happened the first time? Especially something like the Nazis. Like how are we gonna learn like what happened? Clearly 1920s Germany was very different than 1945 Germany. What the fuck happened in 25 years? So what we're essentially talking about the year 1999 America versus 2024 America. Imagine a shift of that magnitude, so crazy that there's a Holocaust in 2024. And in 1999, everybody's just hanging out. Yep, that's right. Well, you should probably study.
And you should probably not reprimand someone for reading a book on this. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, exactly. And look, the German people went along with it. Right? And so, you know, how did that happen? How did that happen? Right. And how many, you know, did they, was there active agreement? Was there passive agreement? Was there, you know, what? What are the steps where things go horribly wrong and how can we recognize those? Because those steps have taken place multiple times in history and recorded history. We know about them. So like if we see them happening today, maybe we should stop it and nip it at the bud. What better way than to read about when it already happened? Yeah. One of my observations about people talking about current events is we know conclusively the prior eras all had horrible moral problems, disasters, you know, catastrophes, wars and all kinds. They made all kinds of horrible mistakes. But we are completely certain that in our time we figured it all out. Right. Right. We're 100% convinced that we have it all dialed in. And the one thing I know for sure is people 50 years from now are going to look back on us and they're going to say, oh my God, those people were awful. 100%. Right. Just it's, but like in what way? Right. In what way are we horrible? I mean, certainly a lot of the way we treat each other is horrible, especially with the amount of information that we have available. But it is fascinating also that if you, you know, I visited Athens last years, last year, and I got to tour the ruins and I was like, oh, I wonder when it all went south. Like when did they, when did they know this had fallen apart? Like when, when was it in the peak of everything? They probably thought, hey, we have the most amazing, sophisticated civilization that's available on earth and we will maintain this. This is how we will be the center of intellectual discourse and the home of democracy. This is us. Yeah. Yeah. And then no. Now there's like shitty apartment buildings next to the Parthenon. You're like, what happened? Something horribly happened. And we don't want to think that could ever happen to us today. Right. We want to think we're American motherfucker. We're going to keep this bitch rolling forever. Leonard Skinner, free bird, let's go. Second amendment. Come on. We think that it's just, this is, this is the future. America is the shining star of the world and we're going to carry this on, but probably not. Like historically. I mean, what is the longest running dominant civilization ever? The Romans existed for what, a couple thousand years? Like how long did the Greeks run? How long did the Egyptian, the Egyptians might be the longest running, especially if you like take into account the possibility of alternative history timelines where they, you know, like Egyptian hieroglyphs, they have Kings that go back 30,000 years. Here it is. Egypt and Mesopotamia. There it is. One estimate measuring the time of the first pharaohs, the use of hieroglyph writing to the native religion was replaced by Christianity. Ancient Egyptian civilization endured for about 3,500 years, but I bet it was more than that. I mean, the argument is just things just really didn't really change. Like changes we understand, historical change of the kind that we understand where things actually change, the way people live changes, really kicked off with the Greeks. And so that was sort of the default status quo civilization for a long time. The Greeks kicked off change as we understand it and then, and then, and then, and then the Romans. Do you know about the fish ponds? The fish ponds. The fish ponds. The Cicero's fish ponds. No. So the Roman empire, you know, ran for, you know, in its sort of Roman Republican empire and it sort of helped what you consider as dynamic phase is sort of vital phase ran for a few, you know, a few hundred years, but maybe 400 years total, something like that. And towards the end, as it was sort of falling or stagnating and increasingly starting to fall apart, a friend of mine says when the roads got dangerous and nobody could quite explain why, right. Which sounds familiar, by the way, Cicero was, you know, one of the great, one of the great Roman statesmen. And he wrote these letters that we have and in the letters, he sends these letters to all of his aristocratic friends. The theme in the letters is basically all of the actual competent, capable citizens of Rome are out in the countryside at their villas, perfecting their fish ponds. Right. They've pulled it into themselves. They built themselves their own protected environments, right, where they control everything. And they're completely focused on ornamentation. They're completely focused on their clothes and on their, you know, lifestyles, right. Kardashians. They were Kardashians. I'm sure. I don't know if the Kardashians have fish ponds, but if they did, they would be spectacular fish ponds. They would be amazing fish ponds. I have no doubt they would be the most amazing fish ponds we have ever seen. So he kept railing, he's like, stop with the fish ponds. Like stop working on the fish, like get back out here, rejoin the Senate, like get back involved in the system. Let's keep this thing from caving in. Yes. And I think, you know, the significance I think of, you know, Trump actually talked about this on the campaign, you know, his version of this talking on the campaign trail is he's like, look, I could be off on a resort, I own all these golf clubs, I have many things I could be doing in my life. Yeah, of course. And he's 78 years old. He probably would like to do that. Right. And he's, you know, surrounded, his family loves him and like, you know, grandkids and like the whole thing. And he's like, look, I'm not doing it because like I need, I need, I need to do this. And it's interesting because, you know, he doesn't use, you know, he's not referencing Cicero when he says that, but it's, it's that spirit that Cicero talked about where, you know, when times get tough, do the people who are in a position to actually make positive 
of change actually step up or not, right? And I think we've had a pretty long stretch here where that hasn't been the case. And I think maybe with Trump, and then I think also with Ilan, I think, yeah, because he was the other guy, right? He, he for sure could what's a coalition, right? It's not just him. It's Vivek Ramaswamy. That's right. Another guy, by the way, who could be kicking it on a beach somewhere. 100% Yeah, very successful and young and handsome. Do whatever you want to do anything. Yeah, exactly. He's decided to go all in. And then you of course, you have Tulsi Gabbard. And you know, you have J.D. Vance, who I think is brilliant. You have all these brilliant people that are together, which is very hopeful. This is what we didn't see out of the Biden Harris campaign, right? You know, what we saw from Harris and waltz, you have waltz this guy who's, it seems like he's a compulsive liar. At the very least, he's lied multiple times about fairly insignificant things, you know, like whether or not he was a head coach or an assistant coach, and the lies have always elevated him socially, right? All the lies about his military service, or at least implying that he served in a different perspective in a different aspect. And then there was Tiananmen Square, this, everything enhances his virtue. This is not what anybody wants. You want the opposite. You know, you want a guy like J.D. Vance, who served in the Marines, and you know, went to Yale comes from a single mother with addiction problems rose from hard work and dedication to become who he is now like, that's the kind of guy that I like. Yeah, that's what we all would like, like, okay, that looks like a leader to me. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the Romans had this concept that took very seriously, they called virtue, right? And like, did you did you there's a whole ranking, by the way, the Roman virtues, and if you read them today, you just like want to burst out crying, because you're just like, Oh, my God, I can't believe what we're missing. But like, yes, people with virtue, people with virtue, it's not just that they think that they're good people, or that they tell everybody they're good people, they actually act on it and actually step up. Well, this is what's missing from today's secular society, right? Like, we don't have like a doctrine that in encourages that sort of thinking and behavior and rewards it publicly, which religion does, you know, what true Christianity, you know, not subverted, fucking giant arena Christianity, where the guys flying private jets and has Rolls Royces and shit, but actual, like real Christian people, right? Well, the Romans, the Romans had gods, I mean, their virtues had gods. Yeah. And so and so they're like, it was actually wrapped, it was your point, it was like encoded into their religion, it was wrapped up in their religion, they knew exactly what was expected of them, they knew exactly what their ancestors expected of them, they knew exactly what their gods expected of them. I recently read meditations again, a couple of months ago, I listened to it in the sauna. But it's it's brilliant. And it's it's amazing that this guy, Marcus Aurelius was thinking like this so many years ago. And it's so it's so valid today. It applies so well to modern life. It's so, so strange. You know, how brilliant this person was, while he was running this incredible empire that he could write about human psychology and the value of forgiveness and, you know, being true to yourself and constantly being truthful everywhere and everything you do and all these virtues and all these the stoicism that he that he espoused. It's it's so valuable today. It's really remarkable that this person who was a leader, was it 2000 years ago, that his words still ring true today. Yeah, you probably know, he didn't write it for public consumption. Right? Yeah. It was even more amazing. His private notebook, which is why it's so good, probably. Yeah. Because he probably wrote it for a sub stack. He'd like, well, people are gonna hate on this. Let me. Yeah. Let me, let me, you know, let me preemptively attack the people in the comments or right, so do them. But he's like, he's like, he's, he's, he's lecturing himself, like he's telling himself how to act, right? Like, you know, he's very, this very deep, these are very deep, important. My favorite, my favorite part of the meditations is there's a section where something like, yeah, you're gonna wake up this morning, and everybody's gonna hate you. And everybody's gonna lie to you. And everybody's gonna make dumb decisions. And you're going to be incredibly frustrated, and you're not going to get any credit for anything. And you have to get up anyway. Yeah, like, that's all Yes, yes, yes, that's all true. Right. And you still have to get up and do your job. And of course, he's saying that to himself as the leader of Rome to himself. Exactly. Yeah. And you know, and what's in there is just like, wow, his life was not, you know, he's just like, again, it's actually, you know, like the CEO, some, it's just like, you're gonna get pounded. Like, yeah, if you're in these positions, you're gonna get pounded every day. If you're operating out of a, out of a, out of a true sense of virtue, if you're operating out of a true sense of like, exercising your responsibilities, you get up and do it anyway. It's amazing how much it resonates. It really is. What's amazing how much so many ancient writings resonate, you know, there's so much valuable information, just like in Sun Tzu's The Art of War, or in the Book of Five Rings, you know, there's so many ancient books that you read and you go first, first of all, I love reading them, because I tried to imagine what, you know, what is this life like in, like, if you want to take like Miyamoto Musashi, 14
1400 when did he live Miyamoto Musashi? He was like 1420s or something like that like What's that like? Like what? What is your life like? What is what is the what is the view of the world when you you? Don't really have detailed maps or you don't have any photographs You don't have any idea what the fuck is going on in Europe unless you go there Like what is what is your version of the world like? Yeah, and then to see someone's words written down and you read them and try to just imagine yourself in their perspective in their mindset Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I look I think if you're somebody like that or somebody like Marcus Aurelius You just have this incredible sense of responsibility Yeah, like you the one thing you do have is a sense of purpose like, you know exactly why you're here You know exactly what your role is, you know exactly how you're supposed to behave You know exactly how you're supposed to basically gain glory how you're supposed to honor your ancestors Like it's it's just all you know exactly where you are in the community, right? Right, you know, right you you have this like incredible sense of groundedness and rootedness And of course, there's huge downsides to that which is it really cuts off your ability to you know, run off and you know You know go on American Idol, right? There's like a lot of things you can't do right but like, yeah, you know You know what you're supposed to do and you either do it or you don't do it And these days to have people like that we need people who choose to be that way Right, which is it which is a you know, which is arguably harder, right? Give it given all the choices that they actually choose to live that way Well, not only that giving all the distractions that people face every day that keeps them from sitting down and writing a journal like that Yeah, that's right. Yeah, you know, I mean back then there's not a lot of different things to entertain you with correct Yes, you had to be maybe a little bit more serious because you couldn't you couldn't have as much fun my favorite No, I have my other favorite Meditations Marcus Aurelius thing is uh, it's something like be the rocks on the shore at which though that which the waves beat Right, like yes, like yes your job is to stand there like the rocks do and just the surf just like keeps coming and keeps coming and Your job is just like stand there and take it imagine what it was like like addressing the people back then to just yelling out into these groups or speaking in front of all the leaders like Yeah, and I'll everyone's plotting to kill you. There's also a lot of that going. Yeah I mean how many times they try to kill Hitler? Like everybody's trying to kill you if you're if you're running things, yeah, all your generals are probably secretly wanting to become the king Yep. Yep, exactly. Yeah, all these surfers are waiting in the wings not easy lives, you know today today most of the killings happen metaphorically Although every now and then yeah Alternative timeline. Yes. Yes, exactly. That's right. That's right. Yeah How fearful were you leading up to the election that it wouldn't go into the new timeline? It was so weird because all the experts said it was 50-50 razor, you know razor-sharp, you know It's this tiny little, you know thing 80,000 votes in eight counties Yeah, and you know and then number one then it wasn't which means we can take all those experts and just dismiss them forever going forward because they Clearly have clearly have clearly have no clue. So it's another set of people. You don't have to listen to but I had this really interesting conversation that kept nagging at me with a senior Democrat who's on his way out of Of politics and he said in the summer I said how how certain is What's your view? And and this person said a Trump's gonna win with a hundred percent certainty. Really? Mr. Democrat And from a sort of purple state, right? So, you know, not New York or California, but like a state with sort of maybe broader cross-section of people and this person basically said yeah Look, it said look all you have to do is fly anywhere in the country into any purple and mark Place and go into a second or third tier, you know side city and take an uber for 30 minutes You know land at the airport take an uber drive around for 30 minutes come back and just ask the driver like how's it going? And who are they voting for and basically a hundred percent of the time the answer is gonna be Trump Because people are just people were just like completely fed up They were just completely fed up and then there was the you know Kamala enthusiasm which this person said, you know, the Kamala enthusiasm is like highly focused in New York and California Which don't matter from an electoral standpoint, right? So they're not gonna decide anything but that is huge when it comes to media. Oh sure, of course, but that's that's the thing It's the self-reinforcing nature of the bubble This is what's actually so interesting with these media bubbles is like the people in these media bubbles are not breaking out like It's like they're getting deeper into this sort of collective psychosis that they indulge in and part of it was getting excited about a candidate For which there was very little popular support for once you got outside of these, you know, heavily blue states Yeah, and so it is in a lot of ways is the most, you know, obvious explanation the world It's just people just fundamentally did not like the direction the country was going in and they were just fed up with it There's also this very bizarre arrogance of people that were certain that Kamala Harris was gonna win I'm sure you've seen the viral video of this lady Who's a political analyst who talks about going to the liquor store and buying a bottle of champagne? Yeah, I don't want to choke the poor lady. She's probably living in hell right now, but I'm blue sky Yeah, she's probably on blue sky she might be on it well she was on X I think she deleted her profile
Yeah, but the poor lady, I mean she but she was being very arrogant and she laughed and mocked this man and said you do Realize you wasted your vote, right? That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. She left which makes her hard to feel. Sorry for that's right It's like you were you were ready to mock this man But in her eyes, it was all about reproductive freedom And she thought that that was under attack under the Trump administration and that women are gonna stand up and they're gonna stop that Because in her echo chamber, that was the case. Everybody was universally. They all agreed We're universally on board with this idea that Trump is evil We got to get rid of them and women are gonna vote and this is gonna be fun But like who are you hanging out with lady? Yeah, you know you could hang out with a bunch of people to think baseball is awesome Yeah, and then you know you run into someone from another country like what the fuck is baseball like you got to realize There's a lot of people out there Yeah And people really don't like being talked down to they really don't and they don't like you Mocking the fact that first of all, nobody wasted their vote Like that's not how it goes like you don't waste your vote if you vote different and the other side wins It's not how the other side won. That's all it is like Wasting the vote is a crazy way to look at it Like because I think also people look at things like tribal games, you know Like, you know in Texas is a huge football state and people love football and it's always we this we that when UT plays South-carolina we this we that it's like people love to be a part of a team that's winning and They apply that especially if they're not into sports to other things. I think it's just a war mentality It's a tribal war mentality that's been sort of subverted in the human mind and applied to other things It could be like Microsoft versus Apple, you know, it could be Android versus Apple, you know iOS It's weird how people get so tribal and then connect their own personal identity to other people agreeing With these ideas that they they believe yeah Yeah I don't know for two thoughts one is the Democrats for a long time with a big tent party So the Democrats were the coalition of people who had very different points of view on things and of course, you know famously It's all the different identity groups and it's all the different, you know economic and unions and all these things and Republicans were like the party of like rigidity, right? And just For whatever said a real lot of the woke stuff had a lot to do with it as it flipped to where at least today Trump's Republican Party is the Big Ten Party Yeah to your point on having all these new people and many of whom are former Democrats a lot of them and the Democrats have decided To try to isolate out anybody right who disagrees on any issue and demand right lockstep conformity through the cancellation process And so that that's a very interesting inversion that happened kind of without anybody saying anything about it But it did happen and then I think the other the other inversion was the economic conversion Remember the criticism of the Republican Party for a long time was it was the party of trickle-down economics? Yeah, the idea was the rich people are going to get all the money because Reagan taxes Reagan administration And then basically if poor people get any money, it's good because the rich people like trickle trickles, right? I think that inverted to where the Democrats especially in the last four years became the trickle-down party Which was we're gonna tax and we're gonna collect all the money and give it to the government and then we're gonna let the government Hand it out, right, but they did it under the guise of tax the rich they did it With this Robin Hood mentality at least they expressed, of course, that's how it starts But then you end up with thirty five trillion dollar federal debt You end up with this giant annual deficit and then you end up with all this money being handed out Right right out and all these grants and all these things like just this there's like shower of money coming from the government But of course if the government's giving you money It also means the government can take money away, right? Like if you're making somebody dependent on you because you're giving the money then you're in it You have a tremendous position of power because you can make their life horrible by pulling the money away, right? You can also control their ideology that way percent. Yeah, you own them like it's it's actually a form, you know It's it's it's on this it's on the spectrum to a form of like domination, right? No, this should make us very uncomfortable and so that and Maybe that would be fine if the debt if the debt in the deficit didn't out of control and inflation didn't get out of control But it did and then at that point it's like okay Like this this new kind of sort of tax and spend driven trickle-down economics is clearly not sustainable. It's not going to work So the way the Trump administration is going to approach the economy they want less regulation They want tariffs and less regulation and they want more More reliance on u.s. Energy, right? they want to drill more more natural gas more fracking more drilling for oil and then allow companies to To work without regulations inhibiting their performance. This will boost the economy You'll have more productivity. You have more American manufacturing. You have more things happening Yeah, so the two headline things you hear from them whenever they talk about the straight line things are number one growth You just need faster growth. But by the way, it's the only way to resolve a long-term fiscal situation It's the only way to resolve the debt. There's only two ways to do it You can inflate your way out of it and end up in 1930s Germany with hyperinflation like that That's one track you can get on which is a very bad track and you don't want to go there or you can grow faster Because if you grow faster Then your your economy can catch up to the debt and you can you can pay down the debt as you grow and so they
They wanna go for a higher rate of growth. And then the other thing is they want America to win. And this is, you know, my partner Ben and I were able to spend time with Trump this summer and that was like his adamant thinking kept coming back, which is like, look, America has to win. And specifically what that means is America has to win in business and in technology and in industry generally, globally. Like our company should be the ones that win these, you know, broad, we should win global markets. Like our company should be the global- How can anybody be against that? I happen to think that makes a lot of sense. Yes. I know, I mean, obviously you're a wealthy man and I am as well, but it's like, how could you not want that? Yes, by the way, if you are in favor of a high level of social support, if you want there to be lots of welfare programs and food assistance programs, all these things, I would argue you also want that because it's the growth that will pay for all the social programs, right? Like that's how you square the circle. That's how you actually have your cake and eat it too, which is like, first, your economy just generates a fountain of money through growth and economic success. And then you can pay for whatever programs you want. I actually don't, personally, like I'm totally fine. Like set up all the programs you want, all the social spending you want, all the safety nets you want. And as long as it's easy to pay for it because you're growing so fast, then everybody wins. Yeah, I mean, I've always said if I knew that I paid more taxes, people in the world, in this country would live better. I would do it. Right, of course. I just don't believe that they're good at spending it. That's the thing, right? Yeah. It's like, if you're putting in this, if you've generated 35 trillion of debt and these are the results. Yeah. Like this is not the deal. And this is my friend that I talked about earlier. That was the point he made. It's just like, look, the deal has been broken. Like this is not the deal anybody signed up for. This is not how it's supposed to work. Everybody knows it. And when you were talking about giving people social programs and giving them benefits, and then you could take that away at any moment. This was one of the big fears that people had about letting illegal immigrants into the country and moving them to swing states, which clearly happened, and also giving them a bunch of benefits, which clearly happened. Money, food stamps, housing, all that happened. Stuff that wasn't available to veterans, stuff that wasn't available to homeless people, wasn't available to the very poor of this country, all of a sudden people who came here illegally got those things. Right, that's right. And the thought was, if you gave these people these things and you gave them a way better life. Look, if I was living in a third world country with a family and I knew that I could come to America and I could get a job, an actual job, and make money and my family's gonna definitely eat, I'll vote for whoever the fuck you want me to vote for. I don't care. My life is infinitely better than it was in this totalitarian shithole that I was in until I walked here. I'll do whatever you want. I just want my family to survive and I think everything's gonna, it's so much better than where I was if I'm in some war-torn part of the world. It's so much better here. I don't care if the Democrats win or the Republicans. I'm in America. And if the Republicans didn't give me any money and they wanna get me out, they wanna deport me. But this nice lady, she gave me an EBT card and I'm staying at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City and I can get a flight somewhere else if I wanna go there? Oh, this is wonderful. So that's how it starts and there is a lot of that going on. But I will say one of the things that's interesting is it doesn't necessarily stick that way. And the sort of evidence for that is the rapid, the sort of dramatic ramp up in the Hispanic vote for Trump. Well, Hispanic people generally are very hard workers. So this gets to the thing. So I'll just tell you a quick story on this. So after the night after the 2016 election, like literally everybody I knew was just like completely traumatized. Like we were all just like completely freaked out. Everybody was shocked. You were freaked out too? Yeah, I was completely freaked out. Everybody was freaked out. Like I didn't expect him to win the nomination. I didn't expect him to win the race. Like, and then, you know, and the media is on like full historical blast and it's the end of the world. And he's, you know, he's a Russian spy, all this crazy stuff that we now know not to be true. It's just like full on. So a group of us, a group of us went out to dinner at a restaurant in Palo Alto. And, you know, and the atmosphere was like a funeral. I mean, like everybody in the restaurant was just like despondent, like ready to slit their wrists. And so we're sitting there eating and like the food doesn't taste good. And, you know, it's just like, can't taste the food. You can't taste the drinks. Like everybody's just depressed. Wow. And, you know, it gets this thing of like, you know, my, you know, my God, I can't believe that, you know, Trump, you know, this, that, you know, so you see, you know, racist and, you know, anti-Hispanic and all this stuff. And it was, it was, it was one of those moments where the young waiter who's, you know, Hispanic young man in his twenties, one of those rare moments where he broke into the conversation at the table. Right? But it was in context. It was like, oh, thank God. Cause like, we're just, we're just depressing ourselves to death. So like, thank God he's going to say something. And he said, you know, I think you guys are looking at it all wrong. He was like, my father thinks Trump is fantastic. My father came here as an immigrant, whatever, 30 years ago, built a life here, became a citizen, bought into the system, pays taxes, like raised a family. Mowing his lawn with a MAGA hat on. He thinks this guy is great. He thinks this guy is fantastic. And he voted for him. And he just has, and, and, and, and, and, and then, you know, you've heard this before, but then it's like, and the thing that this guy said, the thing my father thinks is terrible is if other people are able to come here, they're able to cut in line. They, you know, they didn't have to go through the process. They didn't have to prove anything. They're not bought into the system.
They're able to jump in and then they're not buying into the system. And part of it may be they're not being accepted, but also part of it is they're not buying in. They're not assimilating. They're not becoming part of what makes America, America. And by the way, in some cases, the criminals are coming across and terrorists are coming across and gangs. And it's like, my father's not in favor of any of that. My father wants to be part of a great society, of a great America, not some dysfunctional, basically just disaster zone. And I remember the group of us, it was my first glimmer of like, okay, I need to like completely rethink my whole sense of like how the world works because- Is that one conversation? Yeah, yeah. Well, it was weird because it was like, so what happened to me is like, so I grew up in rural Wisconsin, which is now like completely Trump country. And so from like zero to 18, like I completely understood the mentality and I was always like explaining to my friends of like, no, no, like this is like a different place and people think differently. And then somehow between the ages of like 18 and 40 or whatever, I just like forgot. And I became a Californian. I became a fully assimilated Californian. And I was just like, well, of course, the Californians are much more sophisticated in advance than people where I came from. And so of course, of course, everybody in California has it figured out. And of course, California is going to lead the country in all this thinking, right? And Trump was for me, Trump 2016 was the wake up call of like, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like that's just like completely, that is such an impoverished worldview of how this country works and of how people think that it doesn't explain what you, because you have to explain what happened. And you have to like, if you have some sense of being able to predict what's next, which is what I'm supposed to be doing for a living, you know, that's what investing is supposed to be. It's like, okay, I got to rebuild my entire model of the world for like how, how, how this all works and how, how this whole system, how this country works. But it was that conversation that, that kickstarted it for me. So what was the process of altering your perspective or at least opening it up? Yeah. So for me, it was primarily, it was reading. And so I started to actually read my way back in history and I went, I actually went all the way back. It was like, where were the origins of like left-wing thought came from and then communism and how did that evolve and, you know, liberal democracy and then also right-wing thought and like, you know, everybody's calling everybody a fascist now. So like, what was fascism? Is that what this is? Right. How, how did, how did the Germans do with it? You know? So all, all of those questions and then, you know, kind of converging on in the last 80 years, like how is that, you know, either stabilized or not stabilized. And so I did that. But the other thing is I just started talking to a lot more people and I just stopped assuming that because I read it in the New York times that it was true and, you know, and, and by the way, and then of course what unfolded in the years, you know, kind of sense was, you know, the, the whole, I followed the whole Russiagate thing like super closely. Like I read everything and I read all the reports. What did you think initially? Did you think it was true? Cause it's like this overwhelming consensus from the entire expert class that of course he's a Russian spy. Right. I sat on stage, I went to Hillary's first post election loss speech, which she gave at Stanford. The very first one. And I sat, we know that people organizing it. So we sat literally like 15 feet from, from, from Hillary in her, in her first appearance. And it's, you know, the whole thing is fraught with just like incredible tension because, and the Russiagate stuff is in full, full blown, full blown display. And I, and I go there and I'm like, all right, this is going to mean to me. And you know, the, in the audience, the Stanford audience, and so it's all a hundred percent Hillary Clinton supporters and I, and I'm sitting there and I'm on my, I'm on my best behavior cause I'm with my wife and I have to like not, you know, I have to not act out. And Hillary gets up there and she says, Trump is only president today because Vladimir Putin hacked Facebook and made him the president. Right. And I'm sitting in the audience and I'm like on the Facebook board and I'm like, that's not like, that's not true. I know for an absolute fact that that's not true. Right. And so that got me thinking. And then the Russiagate stuff unspooled and I was like, you know, the whole, the, the, the, the, the steel dossier and like all this stuff comes out. What was the accusations about Facebook? How did she think that Russia hacked Facebook and made Trump the president? Yeah. So it's this whole thing with, it's just, I remember this whole thing, Cambridge Analytica. And so it's, it's this whole thing that there was this, basically there was this data, there was this theory, which by the way, it's like completely, it is like a completely fake thing. Like this didn't. So there was this data, there was this, there was this data set on user behavior that in theory there's an academic, there's a theory that you could sort of impute human behavior from this data set. And then you could use it to predict what people would do and how they would react to different kinds of messages. And it was like this like magical breakthrough and basically thought control. And then there was this company called Cambridge Analytica in the UK that figured out a way to do this. And then it was this like new kind of literally like mind control, like, you know, by far like the most powerful meme weapon of all time for getting people to vote the way that the way that you want. It was this data breach of face. The whole thing was weird because Facebook had been criticized for a decade leading up to 2016, that it kept all the data closed. Right? So the criticism was Facebook never lets any of the data, it doesn't share the data, right? And the criticism for years was Facebook is the Roche Motel of data. And the virtuous thing for it to do is to actually free the data and let everybody else have access to the data. And then in 2016, like flipped 180 degrees and it was Facebook is the most evil company of all time because it let Cambridge Analytica get access to this data. And then Russia ran basically a psychological operation on the American citizens using Facebook pushback. They did. It's just they did early on. They do today in their way. But you know, they're trying to run a business. They're trying to get to the next quarter. They're trying to get the employee base and everybody.
Copacetic they're trying not to get just completely destroyed by the politicians. They're getting right slammed every single day on every conceivable issue you can imagine and It's actually very interesting when you're in when you're in these companies like these these big issues are big issues But you're also literally trying to like make the quarter, right? You're right. You're trying to ship your products You're trying to close your sales. You're trying to keep your employees from quitting, right? You have these you have responsibilities, right? You have practical concern responsibilities and so sometimes these companies get kind of wedge because they can't do the things that they would do if they were just in damage And then they write and then they you know, then they and maybe the message doesn't get out But so what was a bigger shift the waiter or the Hillary speech? Oh, it was the waiter I mean by that it was the waiter was the much bigger shift because it was listening to a normal it was listening to a Person with their feet on the ground actually explaining the way the world worked. Whereas with Hillary it was it was Cope, right? It was it was delusion She that it was it was amazing. By the way, she then spent the next hour and a half When I when I'm in a place where I don't know if I'm gonna control myself I bring a little notepad along because I can work out my demons like Right like super bad, so I brought my little notepad My little pen little Fisher's Space pen, right? And I wrote out and I started making a list of all of the people and organizations that she blamed for her defeat that Were not named Hillary Clinton And I got to 20 My favorite was Netflix, by the way She blamed Netflix. What did Netflix do Netflix aired anti-clinton documentaries? Oh I mean facts. Well, this is particularly funny because the CEO Netflix is a famous Democrat. He's a super Democrat Democrat well, not actually Dead but also read specifically read read read Hastings and his wife are very enthusiastic left-wingers But I mean it was just this litany of you know Basically excuses and complaints right with no sense of like responsible personal responsibility at all You know just like pure grievance and so it was the negative was negative lesson of like, okay Like whatever that is is not the path. Did she blame Comey? Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Oh, yeah. She definitely hated that guy Yeah, no question. That was a wild one hundred percent. Yeah, exactly. And by the way, like that was super weird Yeah, you know, I don't think she was completely wrong. I don't understand that one Honestly, if they didn't want Trump to win, I don't get that one Well, she's good. She we know she's guilty, but we're not gonna charge her right is a weird. That's crazy It's a weird message Almost as weird as the Biden one where we don't think he's confident to stand trial For the documents that he had that were classified exactly, but he can what have his finger on the button The fuck are you talking about exactly? We know we know he's guilty But we never convict him because the jury would say that he's a senile old man Which is crazy because he's still running for president at the time. He's running for re-election well then remember everybody at the time said the media said that the prosecutor was lying right because we sharp as attack My favorite is Joe Scarborough. Yes. This is the best Biden Intellectually the best one I've ever seen like dude. Yes, and then meanwhile, he had to go to Mar-a-Lago and kiss the ring My favorite was the remember the about about earlier this year was the invention of the term cheap fake cheap fake Cuz everybody's worried about the AI deep fake which really didn't then there was really not nothing nothing happened to that And so the cheap fake we learned is a video that just simply shows you something Right It's claimed to be out of context, but it actually turns out that it's actually just telling you the truth She didn't Nancy Pelosi start using that one cheap fake. Yeah, exactly Well, because the theory was it was gonna be clips out of context Yeah, but it turned out there were clips in context. Have you seen there's a gentleman who made a video? Here, I'll send it to you It's pretty fucking crazy of what AI is capable of now by Come on on my phone updated you son of a bitch. Come on. Don't make me go to a fucking Android cuz I will This guy did this insane Video where it's all completely AI and everything he did Including his voice. It's here. I'll send it to you Jamie It's 100% AI generated and it's so hard to believe And it's so hard to believe because it's so good and It really puts you in this when you're talking about cheap fake. I just sent it to Jim cheap fakes and deep fakes Let's put the headphones on to watch this because it's so crazy We're at that moment where you cannot tell right and let's look at this one because it's pretty Extraordinary. This is the best version that I've seen so far. This is completely AI To speak like me one of our company I can okay text and it will sound like me Then I trained Haygen with a video of mine I input the audio file to generate a video based on my text the video you are watching right now is the result 100% generated in AI What do you think of that guys? I know this might sound crazy. How crazy is that? Oh, that's your company. That's him Yeah, that is
That's the AI generator. Yeah, yeah. That's right. That's right. That's right. So it's two companies. One of them, the voice is ours. And then there's another great company called Heygen that did the visuals. But yeah. No, that's right. That's nuts. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, this is part of the first internet election. Probably the first internet election will be the one that has this kind of thing actually in it where people get tricked. Why didn't they do that with Kamala Harris? Well, it turns out- They would have done an amazing job. They could have like really knocked it out of the park with a solid speech. They didn't, yeah. Just have her say it on the internet. Yes. There's a bunch of viral videos of her speaking so eloquently and perfectly. One would think. Exactly. That's the fear of the future. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And so I think that's going to be the kind of thing that's going to happen in terms of like the dirty trick side. I think that will be a part of it. Right? Yeah. There's always some way to try to game these things. Just have the most brilliant writers formulate, get AI to do it. Like you're saying, AI has all these solutions to things that are super logical. And well, there's no weird thinking in it. It's like cut all the fat out. So I think we have a theory on how to fix this. And the theory basically is we're going to have to switch our sense of what's real from basically just trying to eyeball it and figure out whether it's real to only taking seriously the things that we know are real. And the way that we would know things are real is we'll have them registered on a blockchain. Right? And so I think the way this is going to work in the future is every politician will have an account on a blockchain service, like a crypto service. And then every politician, whenever they say anything in public, whenever they're going to have people around them with cameras all the time, whenever they put out a statement, they're going to cryptographically sign it on the blockchain so that it can be validated that it is actually content from them. And then I think we're just going to have to reach an understanding that we're just going to have to write off everything else that we see. Wow. Which frankly is a good idea anyway, because there just is a lot of noise in the environment. How would you integrate that with social media though? Because one of the issues is these low information voters that are getting information either from clickbait headlines on these websites where they don't even read the actual paragraph which might be completely different than the headline itself. The headline is just inflammatory. And then viral videos. Like how would you? So the thing is, so that's already happening even pre-AI. Right? And so I would say that's a pre-existing problem. And so like we can't, you know, we can't. And by the way, that's been happening for a long time. Newspapers have been scandal sheets forever. If you go back hundreds of years to the first newspapers, they were running all kinds of scrollers. The first newspaper was a scandal sheet of the Vatican, like in the year 1500. And it was all these like terrible rumors about like the Pope and the bishops and all these, the Cardinals and all this. That was the first newspaper? That was the very first newspaper was in the Vatican. And then the American, all the American colonial newspapers were like that in the revolutionary era. It was all crazy rumors and innuendo and people accusing each other of, there was a famous election in 1800, which was Jefferson versus Adams that we think of as these like super upstanding, you know, upright people. And they're just like smearing the crap out of each other in their respective newspapers, right? Because they would actually own newspapers in those days. Oh God. And they would just attack each other. The more things change. Ben Franklin, Ben Franklin, Ben Franklin, you know, printed newspapers before he became a, became when a government and he created 15 different sock puppets, created 15 different pseudonyms. He was, he was a suit or a nun. And then he would basically have them argue with each other in his newspaper without telling people that it was all him. So he had all these different personalities. And so like, we've been in a world of like information warfare for a very long time. We've been in a world of sensationalists, you know, nightly news. If it was a, if it bleeds, it leads, you know, sensationalist stuff for a long time. We've been in the world of like, yeah, propaganda for a long time. So, so that, you know, that, that you're not going to, you're never going to make that go away. But isn't it funny that we don't think of the past like that? Oh yeah. We just assume. We think of them as being virtuous. We assume they had it all figured out. Yeah. That, that very much is not true. There's all kinds of crazy, crazy banana stuff. My favorite is in the Vietnam War, what was the, it was the, the Gulf of Tonkin that sort of kicked off the sort of big escalation of, like we now know for a fact it didn't happen. Right. It just didn't happen. And now there's this big debate about like, did they know it didn't happen or did, you know, did they fake, fake it? But like, so there's always been stuff like that in history. So that we can't fix and AI will be a new way to do that kind of thing. But what we can do is we can reorient people to say, okay, now you're going to have to like take seriously, this stuff is real. And if you want to actually know what's happening, this stuff is real and we can prove that it's real. And if it's not, it's entertainment and you can choose to believe it or not, but you should not rely on it. And look, it's not going to be perfect and it's going to take time, but there is, there is a way to address this. Okay. Okay. So that would be the solution to deepfakes the blockchain. Yeah. You flip it. You flip it. Yeah. You focus on the real stuff. That's logical. That actually does make sense. So that, that actually kind of gives me hope. I do generally have hope, even though I look at the pessimistic side of things, I'm generally optimistic because my real feeling about human beings is most people are good. I genuinely believe there's far more good people in the world than bad people. There's far more people that just want to live a good life and have a good time and enjoy themselves than there are people who are tyrants. Yeah. I'm super optimistic. I'm incredibly optimistic. And I was optimistic already with flashes of pessimism, but like I'm really optimistic and especially now.
So I think this is gonna be I think we have the real we have the real potential here for Golden Age Like we really do really do. Yeah the capabilities that we have and the people that we I mean look in my day job I meet these young, you know I meet these 22 year olds every day that are just like the smartest people in the world It's as far as people I've ever met. I think they're getting better. By the way as time passes there by the time They're 22. They just know a lot more. Mmm. They have so much more access to information than we did Yeah, there's so much better train capable and ready to go Yeah fire it up and they know each other able to connect online and they're already in communities and they know how to help each other and so like yeah the productive and inventive Creative, you know aspect particularly of this country is just like there's never been anything like it in the world I think there's also the real potential for a shift in perspective a positive Patriotic shift in perspective that can happen in this country And if you think about What happened with the woke ideology how it swept so quickly over the country and changed so many aspects of the way we deal with? Things socially it happened so radically and so quickly in such a large change that people are Susceptible to change it's possible to To enact change and a positive change in a good direction where people are optimistic about the future which you are and I am I mean, I think that's probably Contagious. Yeah, that's right. I really do think that it's an upward spiral It was Evan Hafer who said that thing about psychology the other day. It was one of is a friend of mine. Who's a former special forces guy said that Psychology is more contagious than the flu. Right? Right exactly. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's right So one of the interesting things that's going to happen right now, you know, we talked a lot about Trump's victory and Republicans But there's now a civil war that's kicked off inside the Democratic Party Which is very interesting because really they because they lost so badly, right? So they the fact that they lost the White House and they lost the popular vote and they lost the Congress and they lost the Senate and they lost the Supreme Court, right like this time It's undeniable that like the current path that they've been on is not working Like it's your foot like being an exclusionary party and kicking people out for wrong thing. Like it's not they're not gonna win election They're not just kicking people out. They're barring people from making it to the primaries. Yes, which is very undemocratic. That's right. That's right Yeah, exactly starting with Bernie in 2016 and then right continuing. So Donna Rice's book. She documented that right? Right, and so so like I would say the smart Democrats know that this is not it's not a viable path You can't have a political party that doesn't win. It doesn't make it's not it's not useful And so you there's gonna have there's a civil war that's underway inside that party that's kicking off right now Where they're gonna have to recalibrate Decide what they want their future to be and it's gonna be a big decision and the same thing happened by the way When Reagan beat Carter really badly in in 80 and then and then and then had a landslide in 84 It then took Democrats 12 years right to get to Bill Clinton and actually win again And so they have this cautionary tale of they went too far in the 60s and 70s and it took them 12 years to recover And so if you talk to the like really smart Democrats right now, they're like look this can't be 12 years. That's crazy We have to do this a lot faster, but we have to reorient and we have to get back to Common sense we have to get back to normal. We have to get back to you know, sensible We were actually playing Bill Clinton debating during the elections of what year was that Jamie I Forget which it was when he first ran. What year did he first run? Oh, yeah So is the 92 and I'm like I vote for that guy. Yeah exactly heartbeat guys. Awesome Also, we played a clip of Hurley Clinton Hillary Clinton where she sounded more MAGA than anybody who's MAGA today She was talking about the penalties that illegal immigrants should face They should pay a stiff fine because they came in this country illegally and if they're a criminal They should be jailed or kicked out of the country without question Like all this was like so MAGA like this is so wild to hear from Hillary in 2008. Yep. That's right That's right. And and Hillary and Joe Biden and what Dianne Feinstein and all these people wanted to build a wall Uh-huh, there's that Dianne Feinstein our senator in California at the time very, you know, very left-wing She was down on the border like to photo ops in front of the wall It was being built like trying to take credit for it crazy. Yeah. Yeah, like 18 years ago. Yeah, and so so yeah so another reason for optimism is I think that they're gonna be able to pull their way back like I think they're gonna be able I think getting Losing this bad is very motivating to be able to pull your way back and become more normal And I think again that would be like I mean how great would it be if you had two parties that actually had like Yes Clinton was running up against Trump. Yes, exactly like he was so good We played that speech that he gave after sister sister soldier It's had a bunch of like very anti white things about white people and he gave this like super eloquent, but yet compassionate speech about this where he's very charitable about her position as being a young person and Not having the the best perspective on things. It was fucking brilliant Yeah, it's really like that's the guy like that's a president now by modern standards. Of course. He was a fascist. Yeah well, that's the because
Because fascism by definition is almost always applied to right-wing totalitarian governments, but it's really kind of just adherence to the state and enforcing a doctrine and forcing people to think and behave a very, which is what the left wing does. And then you talk about like being pro-war, well, who's more pro-war right now, Trump or the Biden administration? Clearly Trump is less pro-war. Clearly Trump wants to end the wars. Clearly Biden just allowed Ukraine to use long range missiles into Russia. Like this is, I don't know what's going on in terms of negotiations. I hear all kinds of different things, but if you looked at one side that is pushing for these wars and seems to be all in on it and the other side that's not, like the fucking polar shift is so dramatic. It's really weird. The free speech thing, which was always a tenant of the left-wing party, it was like, you know, I mean it was doctrine. Like free speech is necessary. It's the foundation of our ability to discuss and find out what's right and what's wrong. You have to be, I mean, the ADL used to let fucking Nazis speak. They used to let them march. They would defend their right to do it. Right. Right. Yeah. Because you needed to air out the idea to be able to show why it was wrong. Exactly. Yeah. So look, it was not that long ago when you had Democrats that were very much in favor of many of these extremely sensible positions. Super recent. It was pretty recent. Yeah. I, but again, reason for, I don't know if they're going to, I don't know if they're going to pull it off. They might just get, they might go crazier. Like they might just go right off the cliff. Like it's certainly possible, but like it is also possible that they'll drag it back and it might happen quite quickly. And I'm, I am hopeful and optimistic. I am as well. I think the temperature of society, like the mindset of society is so clearly moving away from that madness that they're going to have to course correct, which is just logical. There's no way they're going to keep doing it the same way or double down. They're just not going to, it's like they're going to go to the way that MSNBC, they're going to become ridiculous. Yeah. That's right. So they have to, which is good for everyone. For everyone. So one of my theories is you can separate the concepts of the United States and America and you can be very optimistic about America and have all kinds of issues with the United States, but still be positive about America. And the difference is the United States is the formal system of the government and the politics and all this stuff we get mad about in America is the people, right? And so you can be, as I am, incredibly bullish about the people. And then it's just a question of whether, on the America part, and that's just a question of whether you can get the United States part kind of lined up to at least not prevent good things from happening and ideally help good things. Well, what are the things that you think about this administration, at least what they're proposing that would move us in that direction as opposed to the way things were going? There's a lot of things. I mean, so yeah, I think you got to start with the DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency that, you know, Ilan. I think it's hilarious that it just winds up being DOGE, D-O-G-E, he's been pushing Dogecoin forever. The universe speaks. Yeah. It's just so, so many things are just so on the nose that you're like, is the simulation real? Yes. I mean, it has to be real. Yes, exactly. Exactly. And Ilan is programming it in the back room late at night in between playing Diablo. We certainly got a good position in the game. And tweeting, exactly. He's the number one Diablo player in the world right now, by the way. Exactly. He just got number one. Which means- Fucking bananas. How does he have the time to do that? Yeah. Yeah. So look, this goes back to what we were talking about before, like it just, it is time to carve this government back in size and scope. It's time to take the overall, you know, you could talk about distribution of taxes, but it's time to take the overall tax load down. It's time to take the spending down. It's time to get the government out of the position of deciding who gets money. It's time to unleash economic growth. Ilan explained that there's more agencies than there have been years of the United States. Correct. Yeah. 450 federal agencies and two new ones a year. And then my favorite twist is we have this thing called independent federal agencies. So like, for example, we have this thing called the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, CFPB, which was the, it's sort of Elizabeth Warren's personal agency that she gets to control. And it's an independent agency that just gets to run and do whatever it wants, right? And if you read the constitution, like there is no such thing as independent agency. And yet there it is. What does her agency do? Whatever she wants. What does it do though? It basically terrorize financial institutions, prevent new competition, new startups that want to compete with the big banks. Really? Oh yeah. 100%. How so? Just terrorizing anybody who tries to do anything new in financial services. Can you give me an example? You know, debanking. This is where a lot of the debanking comes from is these agencies. So debanking is when you as either a person or your company are literally kicked out of the banking system. Like they did to Kanye. Exactly. Like they did to Kanye. My partner Ben's father has been debanked. Really? By an employee. For what? For having the wrong politics. For saying unacceptable things. Under current banking regulations ... Okay, here's a great thing. Under current banking regulations, after all the reforms of the last 20 years, there's now a category called a politically exposed person, PEP. And if you are a PEP, you are required by financial regulators to kick them out of your bank. What? 
politically on the left. Well, that's fine. No. Really? Because they're not politically exposed. So no one on the left gets debanked? I have not heard of a single instance of anybody on the left getting debanked. Can you tell me what the person that you know did, what they said that got them debanked? Oh, well, I mean, David Horowitz is a right-wing, you know, he's pro-Trump, I mean, he's said all kinds of things. You know, he's been very anti-Islamic terrorism, he's been very worried about immigration, all these things. And they debanked him for that? Yeah, they debanked him. So you get kicked out of your bank account, you get kicked out of the, you can't do credit card transactions. How is that legal? Well, exactly. So this is the thing. And so, and then you go to this thing of like, well, there's no, this is where the government and the companies get intertwined, back to your fascism point, which is, there's a constitutional amendment that says the government can't restrict your speech, but there's no constitutional amendment that says the government can't debank you. Right? And so if they can't do the one thing, they do the other thing. And then they don't have to debank you, they just have to put pressure on the private company banks to do it. And then the private company banks do it because they're expected to. But the government gets to say, we didn't do it. It was the private company that did it. And of course, J.P. Morgan can decide who they want to have as customers. Of course. Right? Is their private company. And so it's this sleight of hand that happens. So it's basically, it's a privatized sanctions regime that lets bureaucrats do to American citizens the same thing that we do to Iran, kick you out of the financial system. And so this has been happening to all the crypto entrepreneurs in the last four years. This has been happening to a lot of the fintech entrepreneurs, anybody trying to start any kind of new banking service, because they're trying to protect the big banks. And then this has been happening, by the way, also in legal fields of economic activity that they don't like. And so a lot of this started about 15 years ago with this thing called Operation Truck Point, where they decided to, as marijuana started to become legal, as prostitution started to become legal, and then guns, which there's always a fight about, under the Obama administration, they started to debank legal marijuana businesses, escort businesses, and then gun shops, just like your gun manufacturers, and just like you're done, you're out of the banking system. So if you're running a medical marijuana dispensary in 2012, guess what, you're doing your business all in cash, because you literally can't get a bank account, you can't get a visa terminal, you can't process transactions, you can't do payroll, you can't do direct deposit, you can't get insurance, you've been sanctioned, none of that stuff is available. And then this administration extended that concept to apply it to tech founders, crypto founders, and then just generally political opponents. So that's been super pernicious. I wasn't aware of that. Oh, 100%. So it was Operation Truck Point 1.0, was 15 years ago, against the pot and the guns. Truck Point 2.0 is primarily against their political enemies, and then to their disfavored tech startups. And it's hit the tech world hard, we've had like 30 founders debanked in the last four years. Real? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's been a big recurring pattern. 30? This is one of the reasons why we ended up supporting Trump, it's like we just can't live in this world. We can't live in a world where somebody starts a company that's a completely legal thing, and then they literally get sanctioned and embargoed by the United States government through a completely unaccountable, by the way, no due process, none of this is written down, there's no rules, there's no court, there's no decision process, there's no appeal. Who do you appeal to? Who do you go to to get your bank account back? And then there's also the civil asset forfeiture side of it, which is the other side, and that doesn't happen to us, but that happens to people in a lot of places now who get arrested and all of a sudden the state takes their money. Yes, that happens to people if they get pulled over and they have a large amount of cash in some states. Yeah, right. Or there'll be, there've been well-publicized examples of there'll be some investigation into safe deposit boxes, and the next thing you know the feds have seized all the contents of the safe deposit boxes and that stuff never gets returned. And so it's this, and this is when Trump says the deep state, the way we would describe it is it's administrative power. It's political power being administered, not through legislation, right? So there's no defined law that covers this. It's not through regulation, right? There's nothing you can, you can't go sue a regulator to fix this. It's not through any kind of court judgment. It's just raw power. It's just raw administrative power. It's the government or politicians just deciding that things are going to be a certain way and then they just apply pressure until they get it. So what happens to those 30 tech people that you know? They go into a different field, like try to do something different and try to, try to, try to get- Complete upending of your life. Yeah, complete upending of your life and try to, yeah, try to change your life. Try to get out of the, try to get away from the eye of Sauron. Try to get out of whatever zone got you into this and keep applying for new bank accounts at different banks and hope that at some point a bank will say, you know, okay, you know, it's okay. We've checked in. It's now all right. Whoa. But there's no- So what do they do with their money? Like what happens? I mean, you go to cash. I mean- Oh, you can't have a- Yeah. So where do you put it? I don't know. Under your mattress? Yes, exactly. Yeah. Exactly. That is so insane. Yeah. So if someone has $30 million in the bank and they get de-banked-
Diamonds art, you know, do you I don't know go overseas somewhere. Holy shit. Yeah Yeah, yeah, and just like it just it just happens and again, it's really important. There's no fingerprints like there's no Right. There's no person who there's no stick above the strings. Yeah, exactly, right It just happened and we can trace it back because we understand exactly, you know We know we know that we know the politicians involved and we know how the agencies work and we know how the pressures applied and We know that these banks get phone calls and so forth And so we can loosely like we understand the flow of power as it happens But when you're on the receiving end of this your specific instance of it, like you can't trace it back There's nothing so these what are the instances like what is the company? What are they trying to do? And how do they run afoul all the crypto startups in the last basically four years so that you remember the crypto crypto thing got Like really, you know sort of everybody got excited and like entities and like all that stuff and right just like stopped Yeah, and the reason it stopped is because basically every crypto founder every crypto startup They either got debanked personally and forced out of the industry or their company got debanked And so it couldn't keep operating or they got prosecuted Charged or they got threatened with being in charged This is a fun. This is a fun twist There's a fun little twist the SC so the SEC sort of has been trying to kill the crypto industry under under Biden and this has been a big issue issue for Us because we're the biggest crypto and crypto startup investor The SEC can they can investigate you they can subpoena you they can prosecute you they can do all these things But they don't have to do any of those things to really damage you all they have to do is they issue what's called a Wells notice and The Wells notice is a notification that you may be charged at some point in the future Like you're like on notice that you might be doing something wrong and they might be coming after you at some point in the future Oh my god. Okay, so terrifying. Yeah, I the eye of Sauron is on you Now trying to be a company with a Wells notice doing business with anybody else. Oh my god, right Try to try to work with a big company try to get access to a bank try to do so That's when they support DEI initiatives and they yeah Well, then the SEC the SEC under Biden became a the SEC under Biden became a direct application of exactly so DEI they started they did a lot with that and then yes all the ESG stuff and ESG is a very malleable concept and they piled All kinds of new requirements into that So through that through this process the SEC could basically just simply dictate what companies do With no accountability at all. Like there's no You know, there's no over there's no over there hearings where they get yelled at but like nothing changed nothing ever happened in a hearing That ever changed anything Wow, it's just the raw application of power right And so this is your friends. This is happened to oh, yeah for sure Yeah, we had like I said, we had an employee who got debanked because he had crypto in his job title He was doing crypto policy for us and his bank booted him because he that's it because they did it They did as they did a screen across that. It's what they told us is they did a screen across their their customer base Anyone because because anybody with crypto became a politically exposed person because wow because crypto was was politically controversial, right? You hear that sometimes it's like complete these terms compliance reputation management, yeah Tone at the top they have these lovely sounding terms that make it sound like everybody's gonna be an upstanding citizen But what they're all code for is destroy the enemy Like bring the hammer of God and the bank and the government or whoever or the or the social media bring it down and just like crush the individual With no due process. Hey look There's an argument in the long run that this is all unconstitutional Because the Constitution gives us all the right to due process and this is government pressure and there's right So like there's probably a Supreme Court case in five years That's gonna find retroactively that this was all illegal. But in the moment when you're the guy who's been debanked Also the potential that if you do challenge them in court and lose the repercussions to be even heavier exactly Yeah, why is it really worth your effort? Yeah, is it worth the risk? That's right Especially if you've already had your life upended you ready to do it again. Yeah, that's right When you barely built yourself back up Yeah, so this is and I think this is important context or like when Elon and Vivek talk about like reducing regulation, you know There's two ways to think about reducing regulation. It's like oh my god The water in there are gonna get dirty and it's foods gonna get poison, right? Some of those regulations I think are very important But the other way to think about it is examples like this Which is just raw government power being applied to ordinary people who are just trying to live their lives are just trying to do something Legitimate and they're just on the wrong side of something the right one power have decided Well, there's something that isn't illegal, but they don't want to be done It's not crypto my crypto or having the wrong political points of view Well, the the trucker, you know, the other great examples the trucker strike up in Canada Yeah was an even more direct version of this because here you had truckers physically showing up and it was something like step one Was they take away your driver's license, which by the way, right? It's just somebody pressing a button on the keyboard No more driver's license. Step two is they take away your insurance and step three is they take away your kids Right, and so like that was their version of this and that was a very specific take away your kid That was the threat at the end to the truckers and the Canada trucker strike Because the truck because the trucker strike in Canada I was gonna jam up these cities because it was the farmers that were the truckers were very serious They wanted
to... They were doing a non-violent protest, but they wanted to stall the cities to be able to exert political pressure back on the government. And the government was like, we'll tolerate it for a little while, then we'll take your trucker license, then we'll take your insurance, then we'll take your kids. And- How did they say they would take their kids? Because it's administrative power. You can't... Right, the theory would be you can't let... These aren't good parents if they're sitting in a truck in the middle of Calgary preventing goods and services from reaching people, putting people's lives at risk. Wow. Child seizure. Child seizure. Now, I don't know if they actually seized any kids, but it's just an example of there is an agency in the Canadian government, just like in the US government, that if they want to, they can take your kids. Well, they were doing debanking there with people who donated to the trucker convoy. That's right. Which is even crazier. That's right. Not even people who were there, people who were opposed to the mandates that Trudeau's administration was imposing on people. And so they donated to these truckers, and then they got their bank accounts taken away, which is really crazy. And so... Exactly. I think the right way to think about this is when we think about totalitarianism, we think about literally World War II. We think about Nazis in jackboots with tanks and guns and beating people up and killing people. That's our mental... And you might call it that hard totalitarianism. That's very clearly violent totalitarianism. But there's this other version you might call soft totalitarianism, which is just rules and power exercised arbitrarily that just simply suppresses everything. And this is speech control and debanking and all these other things that we've been talking about. And the good news is they're not coming up and beating you up in the middle of the night. The bad news is you are under their complete control, and they can do whatever they want to you that doesn't involve physical violence, which basically includes the entire aspect of... Every aspect of how you actually conduct your life and support your family and get an income and everything else. And most people aren't even aware of it. Yeah, that's right. And then, look, these are individual one-off things. Most people don't have a voice. It's very hard to organize around these. And then, by the way, if there's an organization that organizes to try to get these stories out, it then itself can get suppressed and debanked. Well, it happened during the COVID lockdowns, right? So the lockdown protests all got suppressed, right? So the lockdown went from two weeks to crush the curve to two months to two years, right? Which is like, okay, what the hell, right? And then there were these protests that were forming up, nonviolent protests that were forming up to protest lockdowns. And you could argue the issue different ways, but people have a legitimate right to protest for that just like they do for anything else. And the next thing you know is all the lockdown protests got censored, just like, boop, gone. And so at that point, the normal process of being able to try to get redress from your government to enforce your rights to literally, for example, see your family all of a sudden, you can't even organize a protest. How much are you aware of what happened with the FTX crisis? Because one of the things that happened with the FTX thing was it was revealed that they were, I think they were the number two donor to the Democratic Party. Do you think that that is sort of a preemptive measure to avoid any of this debanking and be financially invested in these people so they're not going to come after you? That was his, it was explicitly his strategy. That was Sam's. Yeah. Sam's approach, Sam's approach was just pay everybody. So Sam's approach was just, I have $8 billion of customer funds that I can use for whatever I want, right? Which was the crime. Right. And then a big part of what he used, some of it he used to like hang out with celebrities and get Tom and Gisele to endorse FTX and the Larry David commercial and all this stuff. But a lot of that money, something like $150 million of that money went to basically just pay politicians. And a lot of that money was paid to politicians with no compliance at all with all the campaign finance regulations that the rest of us all have to comply with. And so the money was just shotgunned out the door. How come they don't have to comply? Well, it was illegal. I mean, it was illegal because he was breaking the law. I mean, it was, to be clear, he was illegal. Now, a very funny thing happened, which is when he was indicted by the US government, they ended up not charging him on campaign finance fraud. Because they'd have to give all the money back? Well, so there's two theories on it. The thing that they said was their extradition agreement with Bermuda, Bermuda threatened to not extradite him if they charged him on that charge. Which is like super weird because you're the United States of America, you can probably get the guy. Number two, did he really want to stay in a prison in Bermuda? Right. And so that was all weird. And then look, there's no evidence for this, but the other theory is, yeah, whoever are the powers that be that decide these things in DC decided to not open it. It's like the Epstein client list. Like there are certain boxes that are better not to open. Well, the campaign finance thing, wouldn't they have to pay it back? So then there's this like panic, the minute one of these scandals breaks like that, there's this panic rush. And all of a sudden, politicians discover philanthropic causes they can donate the money to. Right. And then, yeah, in the fullness of time, the trustees might come claw the money back. So yeah, it'll play out however it does. But it is it is interesting. It is a great example of it was the shotgunning of money into the system under like basically just like nakedly breaking the law. And then it now look, he's in prison.
So their argument is he's in prison, he's in prison already, like whatever, it just would have been another sentence. But he did break the law, and he was not actually charged on that, and that prosecution has not happened, and probably sitting here today never will. What's really fascinating about him is that he was right, and if they didn't come after him, he would have gotten all that money to those people. It seems like it kind of turned around, right? It didn't get him off the hook, though. It didn't? No. Well, he still did something illegal. He did, yeah. Did he know it was illegal? No, he didn't. He was in prison. I think it's really hard to get inside that guy's head. I don't know that I can represent his mental state. He'd be a fascinating podcast guest if he was out. He flopped very hard at trial. He had an explanation, but the jury didn't buy it. What was his explanation? That it was all the money was all being invested, and he was going to give it all back, and it was all this and all these complicated theories around all this effective altruism and this and that and the other thing, and the prosecution was just like, it was the customer's money. It wasn't your money. Right. What the fuck? Clearly. Yeah. I don't know. Well, there's also amphetamines involved, which definitely tend to skew your judgment. I mean, him and that lady were sort of proponents of amphetamine use. They were taking ... There was some anti-Parkinson's drug they were taking that has a side effect of reducing your risk calibration. Oh, dopamine agonists. Yeah. One of those. Yeah. Like Reaquip. Yeah. Something like that. Wow. He was taking these patches. That makes you do wild shit. That also makes people gamble. Yeah. Exactly. Well, yeah. Yeah. There was a guy who won a lawsuit from GlaxoSmithKline because he took Reaquip and became a gay sex and gambling addict. Yeah. I think they paid him the equivalent of like 500 plus thousand American dollars. I believe it was in Ireland. Yeah. Yeah. I think they're like, oh, these guys are weird. They do strange things to people. If that happened to me, I would definitely sue. That's crazy that those guys were taking those things. At least Sam was. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, boy. What a wild fella. Yeah. M. Sam. Confirmed. He wears an M. Sam patch. What's an M. Sam patch? He's supposed to use the depression medication. Oh, his supposed use of the depression medication had kicked up some rumors. So what is ... That's the stuff? That's the anti-Parkinson's? I think that was ... Yeah. Is that a dopamine agonist? Does it say? I'm not sure. I'll look it up on ... Yeah. See, put dopamine agonist. Yeah, Parkinson's. There we go. Yeah. Interesting. So it's like related. If it's not that, it's like a related classifier. Interesting. How does it work? Does it say how it works? Commonly used to depression. How does it work, though? Here we go. Okay. It's an MAO inhibitor. Interesting. Okay. That's a different one that says it's sledgeline- people take that as well as a nootropic I've heard. Yeah. That's what it is. So it isn't a sledgeline. Selagine? Selagine? Sledgeline? I think it's sledgeline. I knew a doctor who was taking that. He was taking it as a- but not in a patch, he was taking it in a pill form and he said it was a nootropic. So monoamine oxide inhibitor. So that's the stuff that's the active- that's what makes ayahuasca orally active. Same thing. Monoamine oxide inhibitor along with the plant that contains dimethyltryptamine, which is not normally orally active. So this guy, if he was doing drugs and taking MAO inhibitors, he was out of his fucking mind. Guaranteed. Because I know people who have taken like prescription grade MAO inhibitors and then taken mushrooms and literally almost never came back. Like got to the point where for weeks they were fucked up and then when they did come back they were like, I almost lost it. Like I was almost gone gone. Like you know, like the dude from Pink Floyd. Like never coming back, shine on you crazy diamond, you're gone. And that happens to people. So this fucking kid with billions of dollars of people's money is taking those kinds of medications and amphetamines and who knows what. Yeah. You know, he had an on-staff psychiatrist who was prescribing all this stuff. Wonderful. Like Hitler. And inside value. Exactly. Once again. Once again, back to Hitler. That's so crazy. What a wild boy. Are you following the theories that are now emerging around ozempic and psychological changes that ozempic causes? No, but I did read that it makes your heart shrink. Well, there's some theory to that, which is very concerning, but there's a fair amount of evidence that it resolves alcohol addiction, certain forms of drug addiction, and gambling addictions. And the current theory is that what it does is it basically, it essentially increases your self-control, your self-discipline, and it reduces cravings. 
There's a theory that this is very positive. Let's say this is true, which is what they think right now We'll see but that's what they think So the theory that it's positive is the theory that you know If we were all like more responsible in our lives, we'd all be more successful in society would go better. Yeah counter-argument would be like Responsible is only part of living and it's only part of what makes a society work and we also need risk-taking and we need creativity Yeah, we need impulsiveness. Yes, right and we need variety. Yes, and maybe we're all gonna get into a channel Right, right and maybe we're not gonna like where that where that that just by itself ends up Yeah, you can't have everybody discipline. You have to have wild fuckers out there. Yeah, that's right You have to have your jelly rolls of the world crazy people. They're fun. They make things more interesting. That's right Yeah, so it's essentially discipline and you know a pill form or an injectable form Yeah, and it's very helpful rather prescribed increasingly starting to prescribe it to alcoholics and apparently it's working quite well. That's crazy Well, that's that brings me to Ibogaine which is the one thing that has like the most success for people with addictions It's illegal in this country people go down to Mexico and go to these Ibogaine retreats. It's apparently I haven't done it But it's apparently this insane Introspective journey, that's very uncomfortable and it lasts about 24 hours It's not something that's addictive in any way shape or form almost everyone says it's a very uncomfortable experience, but you gain Unbelievable insight into What is wrong with you that makes you want to pick up heroin like what it what's going on in there that you're trying to? escape like what is this pen it Recognizes that pathway and puts a chemical stop there It actually like stops people from having addictive cravings and it rewires the way they think about things particularly beneficial to veterans a lot of veterans who have just seen way too much and come over and they're all fucked up and they Don't have any way to straighten their brain out and they've had tremendous Benefits using that, you know, I wonder with particularly with these These ozempics and Waco V and all these different types of weight loss diabetic drugs I wonder if there's a way to mitigate these side effects because you know when I've talked to people that Think that like my friend Brigham Brigham Bueller who runs weights too he he's Concerned about side effects of it, but he's also he looks at people that are Just morbidly obese and he's like these people they need some fucking help They've gone down this terrible road. Yes. They shouldn't have done it. Yes. Okay. We all agree to that Don't don't eat pie all day But if you've gotten to 500 pounds, you're probably you're in a bad state and you could probably use some help And maybe that could get them back on track And maybe there's a way with maybe strength training because one of the things is they lose a large percentage of muscle mass and bone Density, maybe that could be mitigated with strength training Maybe it's one of those things like if you're going to get on an ozempic you must lift weights three times a week Which is that might be it. I mean if it's just losing tissue, there's certainly that's that's Relatively easy to fix right? That's right. And there's by the way, there's a ton of R&D going into these drugs right now So there's any more versions of these things? I'm hopeful that we could develop something where no one can ever be obese again. Yeah, that would be really interesting I mean, maybe this is just the first steps of this right and then like these are crude versions of what will ultimately be a Very comprehensive way of addressing an issue like that Yeah So the other thing I'd say so I've been down in Florida the last couple weeks working on some of the you know stuff Happening down there and I one of the things I learned is that the RFK the RFK is really in charge Of health for the country from here, you know for like he's really in charge and you know working with the president and He you know for all the controversy around some of his positions like he's you know, this whole Maha, like he's very serious about this. Mm-hmm And a lot of people including a lot of the most qualified people I know in the field are like yes It is long overdue that we look at the food system. Yes, and we look at all these all Whatever to your point the horrible track that we've been on for 40 years. Yeah, just a complete catastrophe And I think it's a there's this concept in psychology called common knowledge Which is it's like it's something that everybody knows but yet nobody states out loud And so it like it's like known but then all of a sudden there's a tipping point all of a sudden It's not only known but it's like obvious all of a sudden everybody agrees on it Yes, and this feels like one of those moments where it's like nutrition behavioral, you know Exercise like the path that people are on to become obese like no like this actually needs to be addressed Yeah, this is actually a profound issue and it's yes It's we're on the road to hell and like it has to get fixed and maybe it gets it gets fixed chemically and maybe it Behaviorally or other things maybe the culture has to change but like it has to get fixed I'm actually I've been very encouraged that that like I think this is not going to be a very big focus here and not just By the government, but I think also in the culture I agree and I'm very encouraged as well And I think as we were talking before about a sort of a shift in perspective of the country I think a shift in perspective of the country towards that being something that you should strive towards. I think that's coming, too I think that's happening right now one of the
happiest moments for me is when I run into someone and they said they were inspired to get fit and healthy from listening to me talking about the benefits of it. And I've talked to so many people that have lost 100 pounds, 150 pounds, they're exercising regularly, they eat healthy, it's fantastic. It's one of my favorite things when I run into people that are fans of the podcast. So one of my theories on this is that, part of this is what happened is, something very specific happened during COVID, which is the public health people by and large looked very unhealthy. Yes, right. They didn't look good. Right. And so you've got these people standing up there telling everybody how they've got to do all the lockdowns and the masks and all that stuff. Yeah, Bill Gates should get jacked. That would be very helpful. He's got a lot of money. It would be extremely helpful. Get a trainer. When he writes the book and goes on the press tour to talk about public health. Stop eating fake meat, get a trainer. That would be great. By the way, it'd be great for him and his family and society. It would be very reassuring. Bill Gates had a six pack. I'd listen to him more. That I think would be absolutely, absolutely fantastic. And so like, it's just this thing. It's just like, well, of course. Like, yes, the people who are telling us all how to live and eat ought to be healthy. Right. And if they're not like- Clearly. And that's where RFK comes in play. 100%. He looks fantastic. Yeah, he looks great. He looks great. Yeah. Yeah. It's just like, wow. Yeah. We're taking pictures. I'm like, dude, you're jacked. I'm gonna put my arm on him. I'm like, you're fucking jacked, dude. Look at you. Yeah, exactly. It's like Venice. There we go. With jeans on. Awesome. Where's that with jeans on? That's old school. I don't get that. That's amazing. That seems weird. It seems like it gets in the way of your squats unless you're wearing like, like origin jeans. Stretchy. It's got a lot of stretchy fabric to it. Stretchy jeans. Stretchy jeans. You know, you gotta, you have to give stretchy jeans, but even then, like, put some shorts on, you fucking weirdo. Like, what are you doing, man? No, it's like, it's like, that's like, that's like, that's like prison yard credibility. It is. That's like, it's fantastic. It is a little, it is a little street cred-y. Old school. You know? Wearing Timbalands. Yes. Timbalands and a pair of jeans and doing your squats. It's kind of crazy. Exactly. But the promotion of health is like, I don't know how anybody could be against that. Do you want more energy? Do you want more vitality in your life? Well, you should be healthier. It's like, you're lit, you have, your body's a race car, and you could choose, if you work hard enough, to jack up the horsepower. Right. You can make better brakes. You can have a better fuel injection system. Like, the whole thing could work way better. Yeah. You just work at it. And that is your vehicle for propelling you through this life. It'll give you more energy for creativity, more energy for your family, more energy for your hobbies, your recreations, time with your friends. You'll literally have more energy as a human, which is what we all like. Nobody likes waking up and feeling like shit. I mean, everybody's been hungover who's had a few drinks, and you wake up in the morning like, what am I doing? I don't ever want to do this again. Why did I do this to myself? And then you can't wait for the day when you feel better. Yeah. Like, you drink your electrolytes, you get your sleep, you do whatever the fuck you can. And you're like, I'll be over this soon. Go, oh, your head, oh. And you know, everybody likes having more energy. It's better for you. And we can promote that as a society. And this RFK Jr. appointment is a really big step in that direction that we've really never had before. That's right, yeah. You have to go back to, like, literally his uncle. JFK had a program like this in, like, 1962. Yeah. It's been a long time. Well, Michelle Obama did for a bit, right? A little bit, although that was like vegetarian, you know, you're getting into, like, vegetarian school. Oh, was she saying vegetarian? I don't know if she was vegetarian, but, like, well, Eric Adams, you know, the mayor of New York, he's been trying to push vegetarian school lunches. Ugh. It's like, no. That's not right. No, that's not right. It's so dumb. I can't wait until they can figure out that plants really can think and feel. Right, exactly. Because they're real close. They're real close to proving that. I mean, they've demonstrated intelligence and allocation of resources through mycelium. There's a lot of stuff that we know now about plants that we didn't know then. I think they're all conscious. I think everything's conscious. Yeah, I think we need audio recordings of the screams. Yeah. When you mow the lawn, it's just like Armageddon. You know that they can play audio recordings of caterpillars eating leaves and it changes the flavor profile of all the plants around it? Awesome. Oh, amazing. Yeah, they've done this because there's a phenomenon when giraffes, if giraffes are eating, if they are upwind and they're eating leaves as the wind comes down and gets to the other acacia trees, the acacia trees will, they'll come up with this phytochemical. They produce a phytochemical that's disgusting to the giraffes and the giraffes will literally starve because they won't eat those trees. And they do this somehow or another through communication. It's like they're preventing war. They're being attacked by mammals and they're like, we have to stop the attack and nature has provided them with this mechanism to do that, which is really crazy. That's amazing. So back to the doge for a moment. So one of the reasons why everybody became unhealthy is because the government directly put itself into the food system and specifically high fructose corn syrup. Right, high fructose corn syrup was an artifact of government agriculture subsidies, right? The country was- Which was good during World War II because we needed food. At one time. Yeah. Right, but like by the 1970s, we were massively overproducing, specifically we were massively overproducing corn.
And the corn lobby, the sort of agriculture lobby, became very powerful. And we have this government agency. One of the 450 government agencies is the USDA, and the USDA has a dual mandate. It's to promote U.S. agriculture, specifically things like corn, and it's also to advise us on what we should eat. And they also do the Food Pyramid, and that's why the Food Pyramid is upside down, right, for all those decades, where we're supposed to eat carbs and not protein and fat, was because literally that's the agency that's responsible for promoting agriculture. And then that agency, it's inserted itself through laws, regulations, and this kind of administrative pressure, and basically said, thou shalt use high-fructose corn syrup because it is a byproduct of corn, as opposed to sugar. And as we now know, that was an absolutely poisonous decision. That was like literal poison, absolutely a ruinous decision, just an absolutely terrible idea. Well, K.C. Means was on here, and she was explaining the very mechanism by which high-fructose corn syrup encourages overconsumption, and that it's essentially like it's an evolutionary thing that like where bears would eat like a bunch of berries to get fat for the winter. It's like these high-fructose corn syrup encourages you to overconsume. Yeah. We were not supposed to be eating this. Right. This was not supposed to happen. It would not have happened. Especially drinking it. 100%. Yeah, 100%. But this would not have happened had the government not made it happen. And so it traces directly back to a government decision to do that. Now, they didn't, of course, they didn't understand the consequences, but that's kind of the point, which is they interfered without understanding the consequences. And so that's the kind of thing where you look at it and you're just like, all right. And then you're 40 years later and you're still doing it. Right. And then at some point you know what the consequences are, and then at some point there's a question of whether they're being covered up. Right. Right. And it's just like, okay, at some point this has to stop. Right. And literally they just need to stop. Like they just need to stop subsidizing corn, they need to stop forcing the food companies to do this. They just need to stop. And so this goes back to like the regulatory reform thing, which is like there's just like a tremendous amount of this that may have been good intentioned at one point, but sitting here today we're living with these horrible downstream consequences and unless somebody steps in with a hammer, none of this is going to happen. And they also have the insane amount of money that's involved because R.J. Reynolds, these tobacco companies, when they were getting sanctioned, they were getting in trouble, they decided, well, let's buy all these food companies. And so now these same companies that lied about whether or not cigarettes are addictive and cause cancer, now these same companies are pushing super unhealthy food on people, or at least selling super unhealthy food to people, which I think you should be allowed to buy. Right. I think you should be allowed to buy whatever the fuck you want. I'm all for that, but I do think we should be like much more aware of what's actually going on, like you're saying, and why this stuff is in there in the first place. Right. Well, and then you get into these other, you know, more delicate questions, but it's like, okay, food assistance programs for like, you know, low-income people and low-income children. It's like, okay, should they be... Do we want little kids who have no control over this to end up on the receiving end of this food production pipeline paid for with government money and being 300 pounds by the time they're 18? Right. And cheaper than other food. And cheaper than other foods because they're subsidized. Right. Because they're subsidized. And so, and you just, you have this very perverse outcome where you have these government officials who have been standing up there for 40 years saying, we're protecting you, we're protecting you, and what's been happening is they've been poisoning us. Yeah. And so, like, stuff like it just needs to stop. And that's where you need something like the DOJ and somebody like President Trump. What would they be able to do to mitigate a lot of these issues? Like how would they, if you want to, would you make it illegal to put high-fructose corn syrup as an ingredient, or would you simply stop subsidizing? Like, and what would be, how would that work within the government? Like, how would you apply something like that? Yeah. So, there are two things you can do. Two of which involve direct action, and then the third is maybe even the most important. So, one is you can just stop doing things that are harmful. You can stop doing things, the government can stop subsidizing bad things. That's an example. Let me give you an example. This is a parallel thing. If you want to clean up the universities, you need to stop feeding them student loans. Right? Right. So, the government should stop paying for things that are clearly harmful. So that's one. And then two is, look, there may be a role for additional protections or prohibitions. And so, for example, maybe you let people freely buy all the Oreos they want, but maybe you can't get them with food assistance programs so that, you know, kids who have no control over it are not being poisoned. And so, you know, you maybe do that. But I always think that the third thing is culture. Like, there's always a temptation with these discussions because the government's so powerful to talk about what the government does or doesn't do, and I think so much of this has to do with the culture. It's actually upstream or downstream from politics, which is like, what is the cultural tone of the country? Right. What's the value system? Right. What are the role models? Right. What are people being inspired to do? Also what form of shaming is in effect? Like, what are we not going to tolerate? Take the perverse fat studies. Like, are we going to glorify obesity? Right. Right. No. No. And that's not necessarily a legal judgment or a court case, but it's a cultural statement.
And it's not that the government should control the culture, but our leaders certainly play a big role in that, both in and outside of government. So for our leaders to step up at a moment like this and basically say, yeah, no, this is not the kind of culture we're going to have, it's not the kind of society we're going to have, it's not what kids should be looking up to, I think is just as powerful as the actual government actions. It's interesting you're saying the kind of shaming, because I don't want to shame anybody for being fat, but boy, does that work. Maybe you should shame parents. Fat shaming works. And maybe you should shame parents if their kids are fat. Yeah. But the problem is there's so many people that are ignorant as to what exactly is going on. Of course. And that's absolutely required. And they're being fed bullshit. 100%. And yes. But again, it's also cultural, which is like, okay, is the media thing, is the media educating people on this? And if the mainstream media is not doing it right, should there be new media sources that are? Yeah. And then therefore, which sources in the media get respect? So we have this giant collective culture question that we all get to ask and answer, and particularly those of us in a position to be able to send messages that a lot of people hear. So that will help. Yeah. That will help move the needle. But what specifically can RFK Jr. do once he actually gets in? Oh. I mean, there's- Oh, yeah. He's a secretary of HHS. He has very broad, I would say, a very broad ability to look at this holistically inside the government. What kind of pushback is there going to be against that? That seems like a wild amount of money is going to be lost. Yeah. So there's the work that the cabinet secretary is like he will be doing formally. And then there's the work that the DOJ and the president will be doing kind of in parallel with that. And there will be some convergence between those. And we'll see. There's a potential here for quite dramatic action on a lot of these fronts. Could you imagine if you're running an agency and you have to have a meeting with Vivek and Elon? Yes. And you got to open your books? Yes. Yes. It's like office space where they brought in the bobs for consulting. Yes. What do you do here? Exactly. That's exactly what it's like. Is there a meme like that? Is there a meme like that? I think there's a meme where they take those guys and they put Elon and Vivek's heads on them. Yes. So there was another key timeline split that happened in Silicon Valley about two years ago. Actually, two and a half years ago when Elon, actually right before he took over Twitter, where he got in an email fight with the CEO of Twitter at the time, who's actually a guy who's a friend of mine. He's a really good guy, but literally this guy had just been promoted from engineering to run the company. And then like a month later, he ends up trying to deal with the Elon situation. So kind of got a little bit sandbagged on it. But yes. Of course he said, Elon Musk says he rewatched office space to prepare for Doge. Of course he did. Of course he did. Fucking psycho. Exactly. God, we're so lucky that guy's around. Exactly. There's this moment in the Twitter takeover where Elon sends his email and he says, and the line is, what did you get done this week? Whoa. What did you get done this week? And in the context of Silicon Valley companies, that was a provocative statement because a lot of Silicon Valley companies take months or years to do anything. But imagine that statement being applied to the government. Oh my God. Right? Like the level of like accelerated, like, okay, what are the problems? How are we going to fix them? And what have you gotten done this week? Yeah. You think debanking upended some lives? Yes, exactly. So yes. What have you done this week? And by the way, when Elon runs this guy, it's actually interesting. A guy just tweeted, a guy just tweeted or posted or Zeded what it's like to work for Elon at his AI company, XAI. And he said, Elon came in last week and he said, Elon spent 18 hours at the office and in five minute chunks. And it was every five, each person had a five minute speaking slot to explain to Elon what they were doing. Wow. And he did that for, you know, five times, whatever, right? 18 hours. Jesus Christ. And so think about what that meant. Every employee had an opportunity to tell the big boss what they were working on. Every employee had an opportunity to be recognized for their effort. Every employee had an opportunity to get live feedback from the big boss who had a comprehensive overview of everything as to what they should be doing. Whoa. And there's no place to hide. Right. Whoa. I think about different it is for a company to be run that way. Right. Then even again, the Valley companies generally are quite well run by sort of business standards. And even that, like that's a level of intensity that most Valley companies aren't even close to. So imagine that applied to government, to government, and it's just, and it's, and again, this is the kind of thing. There's no law that like, there's no reason it can't be done. There's no law that prevents that. There's nothing in the constitution that says you can't do that. It's a choice. How the government is run as a choice on the part of the executive branch and the president for how it's going to get run. And there's no reason why the government can't literally be run, be run this way. And here's what's crazy. The pushback against even the concept of this by leftists. So leftists defending bureaucratic bloat and big government is wild to watch, which they really shouldn't be doing, which is a weird thing to have wedged themselves into. My hope is they'll figure out how weird this is. Do you think it's like just an ideological thing? Like the right wants this. So we oppose it. I think, I think they. 
think the left thinks they control the government. Like, I think 50 years ago, they would have been on the other side of this, of this issue. Like, like Noam Chomsky 50 years ago, of course, would have been on the other side of this. He would have viewed government power as an extension of like the state and big business intertwined. And you have these texts just term manufacturing of consent, where it's like government and business are conspiring against you. Yeah, so he would have been on the other side of this. But I think today's leftists think they control the government, which in many ways they do. Well, so Washington, DC, Washington, DC voted 94% for Kamala, 6% for Trump. Right. And so okay, so two data points that is data point number one data point number two, four of the 10 wealthiest counties in the country are suburbs of Washington, DC. Wow, lobbyists, lobbyists. Yeah, they call beltway bandits. Yeah. Crazy job is the actual term. And these aren't people working for the government. These are people making money from these are these are people sponging sponging off the government. And so, like, yeah, for to the extent that Democrats have wedged themselves into a position where they're defending this, they really shouldn't they should really rethink this, they should figure out how to get back to right the correct the correct mentality on this that they used to have. If there's less government bloat, then there's less tax dollars. You don't you don't have you don't need as much money to fund these things. That's right. There's like people can be taxed less, there can be more allocation of these funds towards the social programs that we all want. You know, most federal workers never came back to work. Really? Yeah, they work from home. Most most. Yeah, very large percentage, something like half just literally just never came back. Whoa, they still, by the way, still draw a paycheck. They're still on their jobs. But literally, they're not in the office. Or in some cases, they have an agreement where there's one agency, but I won't name but there's one agency where there's there were the there's Okay, here's another great thing. There are agencies of the federal government whose workforces are both civil servants, civil civil civil service protections, and the end unionized entirely paid for by the taxpayer, but they both have civil service protections, which by the way, are totally made up. There's no concept in the Constitution of like civil service protections. It's just like totally made up thing. And they're unionized. And then there's a particular agency that I know of where the union agreement the union negotiated the return of the office from COVID. And the agreement was you have to be in the office one day a month. Whoa, and actually what the pattern now is what they do is the employees come in on the last day of the month and the first day of the following month. So they only have to be there for two days for two months out of out of 60 days. That's crazy. As a consequence, many of them have actually left the area. Right? Because they get their government paycheck, right calibrated for living there. And then they go live someplace nice, you know, someplace nice, but you know, they go live in the Ozarks or something where it's right. cost of living is cheaper, and they have a bigger house. And you know, in theory, they're working from home, but like, you know, like, is it is it actually happening? So and this is why again, this is the does one of the things that the does they've they've already announced. The thing they've said is you can work from home just not for the federal government. Right? Yeah. And so when people are talking about like, is the does going to be able to do anything like it's just okay, there's 50% of the federal workforce. Right? And as you know, and as yes, as a taxpayer, how do you feel about that? And, you know, to your point on paying taxes, like if those people are in the office and they're dynamos of activity, and they're making the country better, right, fair enough, of course, but if they're kicking it at home, right, maybe not. Yeah, maybe not. And that's how much oversight has there been on whether or not they've been kicking it? Excellent question. Yeah. Now, it turns out there are ways there are actually there are ways to figure this out. So for example, for many, for many jobs where you have to log in, to be able to get access, like to email, you can actually in like, often you have VPNs to get into the corporate network, you can actually audit and you can see who's been working. And then there's a do you know about mouse wigglers? Yes. Yeah. Yes. Programs. No, no, actually physical. Oh, they're physical mouse. Physical mouse wigglers. And so it's a physical device that holds your mouse and then intermittently wiggles it. And a friend of mine who runs a big tech company, he just had like a nagging feeling in the back of his head that maybe all of his remote worker workers weren't pulling their weight. And so he actually wrote himself on a weekend algorithm to inspect all the mouse movements of employees for a week. And then and then he bought all 50 like mouse wigglers from China that you can buy. And he fingerprinted them all. And he found that he had a whole bunch of employees who were using mouse wigglers. Wow. Right. And so how many federal employees are using mouse wigglers? Right. So how crazy is that? That's how they can measure whether or not you're active. Yeah. Whether your mouse is moving. Yeah. Like what are they what are they seeing? Just just a pattern of movement of the mouse. That's it. Well, the mouse the mouse wiggler is moving in a way that you can fingerprint. So is this like you do you agree to a certain amount of disclosure of your personal information while you're working? Like how do you get access to mouse wiggles? Oh, so it's very common. So in corporate environments, it's very common that your your company issued computer has some kind of software on it that lets the company control the software and gives them and gives the company some level of visibility into what you're doing. And that doesn't mean that doesn't mean they're washing literally washing you. But it means that they have the ability to kind of reach in and be able to be able to see, you know, how much is the computer on? Wow. Is the mouse moving?
That's actually a reasonably common thing. I heard the most ridiculous argument against this. They're like, what are you going to do with all those employees that get fired? Like, what are you going to do with all those people who are stealing hubcaps? They're making a living stealing. What are you going to do if you make hubcaps stealing illegal? Like, what are you talking about? They're essentially stealing tax dollars. If they really are doing something that's totally useless, and we're wasting enormous amounts of money on this every year, the argument that what are you going to do if those people can't do that anymore is really crazy. Yeah. Well, the answer is they can do something productive. Yeah. And people are more than capable. You don't have to infantilize someone to say, like, this is the only thing they're capable of doing. Exactly. They've worked for the government for 20 years. This is all they can do. Yeah. And then, by the way, there's multiple knock-on, positive knock-on effects. If you can cut government spending, there's multiple knock-on effects. So one is, if you cut the spending, you can cut the taxes, and you can just simply, the private economy then just simply has more money, because it hasn't been taken. And so if there's less public spend, there will be more private spend, because the money reallocates. And so there might be just as much demand in the economy as just coming from people choosing to buy things instead of the government forcing it. So that's number one. Number two, you can bring down government debt, which means you can bring down government interest. And the government today, the federal government today pays more in interest than we pay for the Department of Defense. Right. But how much of that is salary? No, no. That's just interest on the debt. Right. That's just interest on the old debt. Okay. So 1.2 billion a year right now, I think, is the latest number, which is just interest on debt. It's not paying for any good or service. It's just interest on debt. Right. But again- What percentage of that is of the GDP? Well, so the total government spending is on the order of 7 trillion. Interest payments are like 1.2 trillion, something like that. 1.2 trillion a year. I think that's the current number. DOD is 800 billion a year. So 1.2 trillion. Just off the top. Yeah, just off the top. And again, nobody's benefiting from that. It's just interest payments. That's bananas. Right. I don't even, I don't know. It's 20, 30, 40 trillion. It's much larger than that. But still. It's enough. This is a lot of money. And the total accumulated debt is 35 trillion. And the total accumulated debt is 35 trillion and it adds another trillion of accumulated debt every 100 days. Yes. Oh my God, it hurts my head. There's a congressman actually, Thomas Massey. So he's the one guy in Washington who talks about this. And he's a liberal. He's one of the economists. He's a liberal. He's a liberal. He's a liberal. He's a liberal. He's a liberal. He's a liberal. He's a liberal. He's a liberal. He's a liberal. He's a liberal. So he's the one guy in Washington who talks about this. And he's one of the only libertarians. And he's a, he's an MIT engineer and he actually designed himself a pocket lapel pin calculator of the government debt. And he wears it every day at Washington DC. So he walks around with this scroll? He walks with a little scrolling LED display. Oh my God. On his lapel. And it literally counts. It counts the debt. And it's accurate. It's pulling data from the US Treasury and it's actually an accurate count. And so it's like 34 trillion, 35 trillion, 36 trillion. Here's the kicker. At the current pace, at the compounding, it'll cross, the debt will cross a hundred trillion in the foreseeable future. So he's already working on the redesign because he needs a bigger device with a bigger screen to be able to display the bigger numbers. How much anxiety do you get standing around him looking at that? That's his goal, right? He wants, because otherwise the status quo in Washington is just let this happen. Oh. Right. And so, so anyway, so, so another way you benefit is reduction of interest. And then another way you benefit is reduction of interest rates. If you bring down the amount of debt in the economy, you bring down interest rates. And then everybody else who buys things, when you go to buy for a house, your mortgage is cheaper. Right? So everybody who buys, anybody who ever borrows money in the real economy then therefore is better off. Right. This is the argument against it being only good for wealthy people. Oh, it's good for everybody. Right. Yeah. It's good for anybody who ever gets car loan, home loan, small business loan. You want to bring down interest rates. But this fundamental discussion of it, like the argument, particularly from the left, is that all these tax cuts, deregulation, all this is going to do is make Trump supporters and Trump's people wealthier, and it's going to ruin the middle class and ruin the lower class. Everyone else is going to suffer. So just observationally, almost all the rich people in our society are, were for Kamala. Right. Really? Yeah. The Democratic Party, so the, so Democrat, Republican, it's a, it's what they call, it's a political scientist called top plus bottom versus middle is the configuration. So the Democratic Party is the top and the bottom versus the middle. So the top is what you might call the sort of upper middle class coastal elites. So it's everybody who went to the fancy schools. It's everybody with the fancy jobs. It's for sure me, I guess your grandfathered in. Yeah. Right. But it's like, it's like, you know, it's like, it's like fancy, it's like high net worth, high income people with primarily knowledge working jobs. Right. So, so some professor, reporter, programmer, right, database expert, author, lawyer, you know, accountant, banker, like all, all this sort of, you know, quote, elite jobs and all the elite degrees, by the way, who all went to the top schools and got like, you know, the, the, the elite degree. So, so that's the top. And then the bottom is what, what you call the clientele underclass. Right. So it's, and it's, it's the, it's, it's the called the rainbow coalition. Right. So it's all, it's the minority groups. Right. And so it's the assembly of, you know, low income African-Americans, low income Latinos, you know, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, recent immigrants, recent immigrants and so forth.
And so that's the Democratic coalition that they explicitly program against and then Republicans in our era Republicans are in them It's it's the middle. It's the middle class lower middle class, you know It's it's all the people who don't have the fancy degrees and that are doing all the actual work That's basically making the country run, right? So it's it's everybody from the small business owner the restaurateur, you know, the truck drivers truck drivers farmers, you know All the way, you know garbage men and janitor Everybody who goes to work nine-to-five has a job probably probably either small business or a physical job, you know You know, it's sort of say labor like real labor like actual labor calluses on the hands, right? Right kinds of stuff so kind of the so-called real economy which is why I write the Republicans are concentrated in the center and the south because that's where all those things are and then Democrats are concentrated in New York and California and on the coast which is where all the symbolic, you know Creative intellectual jobs are and so so so and so so the weird thing that's happened is Progress liberalism progressivism started speaking for the working man, right like a hundred years ago It spoke for the working man. And now what's happened is there's been a complete reorientation where the working man Has separated out and then and then you saw that in this most recent election Where the unions the union leadership still for the most part endorsed Kamala but the rank-and-file Voted majority for Trump in a lot of cases and the the data point that I remember is the teamsters voted 70% for Trump What do you think the motivation of all these wealthy people to vote for Kamala Harris was because they feel great Because they're saving the world It's amazing to be in charge and control society and decide how everything works and decide who's good and who's bad and Like you're elite you get to be the elite you get to make the elite decisions And if you want to be in that group you have to got it you got it you got to do this and you feel good about yourself because you feel like what you're doing is on behalf of You feel like what you're doing is on behalf of your client of your clientele and it's reinforced by the echo chamber you live in Yeah, and it's just it's why the con if you read if you read the media on New York Times It's just it's it's either New York Times only has two articles anymore It's either how evil are Republicans or how, you know, innocent and helpless are, you know You know poor aggrieved minorities or you know identity groups Right, and so the oppositional force and then but we're the party of good with a capital G Because we're taking care of all these poor marginalized people. So it's a very compelling You feel great about yourself, right? It's just absolutely amazing And then by the way, it just so happens that the economy is wired up in a way where you're getting paid a ton of money Yeah, working very hard Great, and then you're completely isolated away from the lived experience of just normal people which is the state that I've found myself in where it would never even occur to you to talk to a garbageman or to a Somebody, you know running a restaurant or whatever because but it's just like you're not affected by the rising crime rates You live in a safe neighborhood, right? And you've got a you know, you're against the wall on the border, but you got a wall around your house, right? Right, and so you just you're in this bubble Uh-huh, and then you only ever talk to people who agree with you, right? And then the media is constantly reinforcing it and then you get ostracized if you disagree and that's that's the wedge like that's the way And it worked like look for a long time it were for 40 50 60 years. It worked as a way to gain and hold political power It's just it's just gotten wedged in kind of this corner where it it can no longer win And so therefore it it has to get reexamined so for you when you had this shift of thinking you Talk to the waiter and then the Hillary Clinton speech and they're like how long is it before you start? Publicly expressing these things and like how much of a reluctance is there? Well, so from 26 17 to 2020 I was just like trying to figure out what the hell was going on and then Kovat hit and then I was trying to figure out what the hell was going on with Kovat and you know our business You know went crazy our business caved in and had all kinds of crazy horrible things happening And we you know, we have all these companies we have hundreds of companies who are responsible for our startups And so we're working with them to try to keep them afloat and get the money and everything But really it was I mean really the big thing was the Biden administration just like flat-out tried to kill us Like they just came like straight at us and they came straight at our founders And so and they tried to kill crypto and they were they were on their way to trying to kill AI I mean they were there were horrible like there were Second was the motivation to kill AI because it says because did they want? They want control I mean they want control they want to control they want to control in the same way They can so they recognize the potential of it. I wanted to head it off of the path They want to control well, they want to put it in a headlock They don't necessarily want to stop it But they want to make sure that they control it in the same way that they controlled social media In the same way that they control the press. So how are they trying to do that sensor? I mean, so it's the it's the AI is think about it as the same dynamics that cause censorship to happen on social media We're also going to happen in AI and and so there's a couple steps So one is you just want a small number of companies that do AI because you want to be able to put them in a Headlock and control them. So you you basically want to give you basically want to have a government You want to bless a small set of large companies with a cartel? And set up a regulatory structure where those companies are intertwined with the government and then you want to prevent Startups from being able to enter that cartel. How would they do that? That's a threat to the control So it's constant called regulatory capture And so the way this is this is happening
It's happened many times for, you know, hundreds of years. This is like a very well-established kind of thing in economics and politics. So if it is, if suppose you're a big, suppose you're a big bank, suppose you're Jamie Dimon, you run JPMorgan Chase, like what's like the biggest possible threat of what you could possibly face. It's that there's some disruptive change that comes along that upends your entire business. You know, your Kodak, you know, your Kodak, you're making a ton of money on, on analog film and the digital cameras come along and you get destroyed. And for the, in your obituary, it's like, you're the idiot. Blockbuster video. Blockbuster video. Like that's the cautionary tale. Those are the ghost stories that those guys tell around the campfire at night. Right. They're just absolutely terrifying. Right. And like business schools teach you, like that's the one thing you do not want to do. And so there's two ways to try to deal with that. One is you could try to invent the future before it happens to you, but that's hard because you're running a big company and you know, these startups are out there doing all these crazy things and can you really do that? And it's hard and frisky and dangerous. The other thing you can do is you can go to the government and you can basically say, okay, we're going to, we would like to propose basically a trade, which is we would like the government to put up a wall of regulation, right? We would like the government to put in place rules, right? That are potentially thousands of pages long. Right. And in fact, the more, the better, right? We want a very, very, very high bar for regulation for what's required to be in this business because I'm a big company. I can afford 10,000 lawyers and compliance people, right? I voluntarily put myself under basically the government thumb. But in return, the government has erected this wall of regulations such that the next startup comes along and just literally the next company comes along and just literally can't function. And by the way, this is literally what happened in banking. So pre 2008, pre the financial crisis, there were many different banks in the country, big, big, medium, small, and lots of new bank startups every year that would, people would just start banks, entrepreneurial banks of many different kinds. After the financial crisis, we had this problem called the too big to fail banks, right? The banks were too big. And so there was this legislation called Dodd-Frank, which was regulatory reform for banking, which was going to fix the too big to fail banking problem. They implemented that in 2011. I call that the big bank protection act of 2011. It was marketed as it was going to solve the problem of the too big to fail banks. What it actually did was it made them much larger. So those banks are, those banks, those too big to fail banks, the same ones we bailed out are now much larger than they were before. The banking industry has concentrated into those banks. All the midsize banks are being shaken out and you know, they're periodically, they'll go under like our bank in Silicon Valley is called Silicon Valley Bank, right? And you know, it went under. And this has been happening all across the economy. And then since Dodd-Frank, the number of new banks created in the United States has dropped to zero. Whoa. And so the banking system is being centralized basically into 10 big banks. They actually have a term, they have a great term called G-SIB, globally significant something, something bank. And so there's like 10 G-SIBs. And then basically what's going to happen is those are going to consolidate basically into the three big banks. And if you get debanked by one of the big three- You're done. You're absolutely done. Oh my God. But think about it from the other side. If you're the treasury secretary and you want your political enemy debanked, it's just a phone call, right? Which is what has been happening, which was happening under the prior regime. Wow. Right? And again, like at that- Zero. Zero new banks. Yeah. Zero. Literally, it was like cardiac arrest. It was like, that's it for new bank charters. And we've had companies that have tried to start new banks and it's essentially impossible because you have to comply with the wall of regulation. You need to go hire your 10,000 compliance people and your lawyers, but you can't afford to do that because you're not big enough yet. So you can't function. You can't exist. Wow. It's ruled out. It's by definition, it's ruled out. You can't do it. It's not financially viable. Wow. Right. So that happened in banking. That's what they've been doing to social media. It's been the same. And by the way, this has happened in many other industries. By the way, this happened in the food industry has greatly consolidated. That's a lot of what's happened in that industry as well. And it's the intertwining of government and the company, right? Because at that point it's like, okay, is this a private company? Yes. Like it's still a private company. It has a stock price. It has a CEO. Does the CEO have to do everything that the relevant cabinet secretary tells them to do? Yes, he does. Why does he have to do that? Because if not, it's going to be investigations and subpoenas and prosecutions and frontological examinations for the rest of his life. Wow. Everything. So it's essentially what we accuse the CCP of doing in China. So if you combine banking and social media and now AI, you have basically privatized social credit score, right? Is where you end up with this, right? And this goes back to the truck or strike thing. You don't have to threaten to take away somebody's kids. You just like, you threaten to take away their insurance. You don't threaten to take away their insurance. It's not government insurance that's being taken away. The same thing has happened in the insurance industry. It's consolidated down to a small handful of companies. They're super regulated. If the government doesn't want you to have insurance, you're not going to have insurance. And there's no constitutional right to insurance. Right. So there's no appeal process. We're back to the debanking thing. And so that happened in banking. That's been happening in internet.
tech, social media generally. It's been happening in many other sectors. And then it's happening specifically in AI. And what you have in AI is you have a set of CEOs of some of the big AI companies that want this to happen. Because again, their big threat is that we're gonna fund a startup that's gonna eat their lunch, right? It's gonna really screw them up. And so they're like, look, if we could just take the position we have and lock it in with government protection, the trade is we'll do whatever the government wants. And if you assume the government is controlled by, you know, people who want to censor and punish and cancel their political opponents, that's gonna come right along with it. And so that's why when these AI systems come out, like nine times out of 10, they're tremendously politically biased. You can do this today. You just go on, you go on any of these systems today and you just like ask, you just start asking like really basic questions. Gemini is the best example of that, right? When they had the multiracial Nazis. The black Nazis. Yeah. Once again, we're back to the Nazis. Yes, so it turns according to Gemini, Hitler had an excellent DEI policy. Yeah. Now, in reality, he did not. And it's important to understand that in reality, he did not. But yeah, Gemini happily threw up black Nazis because they programmed it to be biased. They programmed it in a political direction. There's this guy, David Rosato, who's been doing these analyses on the social media side, where he shows the incidence rates of the rise of like all of the woke like language, like in the media. And there are similar studies that have come out for the AI where there's studies that have been done that basically show the political orientation of the LMs. Because you can ask them questions and they'll tell you. And they're just like nine out of 10 of them are like tremendously biased. And then there's a handful that aren't. And then there's tremendous pressure. This is one of the threats from the government is, is the government basically gonna force our startups to come into compliance, not just with their trade rules, but also with all of their, essentially a censorship regime on AI that's exactly like the censorship regime that we had on social media. Wow, that's terrifying. Yeah, exactly. And yes, and this is my belief and what I've been trying to tell people in Washington, which is if you thought social media censorship was bad, this has the potential to be a thousand times worse. And the reason is social media is important, but at the end of the day, it's quote just people talking to each other. AI is gonna be the control layer on everything, right? So AI is gonna be the control layer on how your kids learn at school. It's gonna be the control layer on who gets loans. It's gonna be the control layer on, does your house open when you come to the front door? It's gonna be the control layer on everything, right? And so if that gets wired into the political system, the way that the banks did and the way that social media did, like we are in for a very bad future. And that's a big thing that we've been trying to prevent is to keep that from happening. And the Biden administration was explicitly on that path. Like they were very clearly going for that. And it was just like crystal clear that's where it was headed. And do you feel like with a second administration, they'd be even more emboldened to act in that direction? Yes, 100%. Another Biden administration for sure. And then there was an open question on Kamala and the open question there was just, as you know, she wouldn't declare if her issues positions were the same as Biden's or if they were different. And so you could imagine a Kamala administration that had a very different approach, but she refused to clarify any of her positions. And so we had to assume that they would be the same as Biden's, which I think is the default case. Now is this a closeted sort of a perspective in Silicon Valley? Do people hide these thoughts that this administration would be bad for business? I mean, much less now than- I mean, look, Elon really broke a lot of, Elon did two things that really opened a lot of this up. One is he bought Twitter, which really gave us a place to talk about this stuff, all of us. But then also he himself, of course, started to actually express himself. And so he gave a lot of the rest of us permission structure to be able to say these things. And then look, it's like a cascade where people are like, okay, apparently you can now talk about things. Okay, I have some things to say. Well, and then look, also just, they went too far, they tightened the screws. I mean, they really came at us hard. And so, you know, and the harder they come at us, like we didn't predict. When Biden won, like we didn't think it would have negative effects on our business. We thought, yeah, probably taxes will go up, but like, we'll just keep doing business. But then they did all these things, right? And it took a couple of years to figure out that this was not like a temporary thing, like this was like a concerted campaign and that they were really coming for us. What agency specifically is involved in doing that? Oh, I mean, it's the alphabet soup, but like SEC, SEC tried to kill crypto very specifically. FTC, you know, was thoroughly weaponized. There's something called the CFTC, which is the other part of the crypto puzzle, commodities, futures. Crypto, there's crypto that's a security. There's some forms of crypto that are security and the SEC regulates. There's other kinds of crypto that are a commodity that the CFTC regulates. The CFPB, I mentioned earlier, so the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, right, decided that they were also gonna regulate AI, which they just volunteered for. And then, you know, the FAA, the FAA killed the drone industry years ago. The reason why we don't have, the reason why the Chinese are winning in the drone wars is because the FAA basically made drones illegal in the US.
years ago, so like the FAA has been a big problem, you know, the, what is it, the F, also the FAA. When you say made drones illegal, but you can still buy drones, like what, what have they done? So, legally, you cannot fly a drone in the U.S. that is beyond line of sight if you don't have a pilot's license. Wow. Which means if you're a U.S. drone manufacturer, you have to build a system that enforces that regulation. So, you have to handicap your ability. Yes. So, either the, either the U.S. drone needs to either not fly beyond line of sight, which is not very useful, right? Right. Or it needs to somehow validate. We only have customers that have pilot, have pilot's licenses. China there's no such restriction. Right. And the Chinese, we have, because we run a more open economy, the Chinese drones you can just buy in the U.S. and use however you want. Technically, as the user of the drone, you're out of compliance with the law, but they ignore that part. They just punish the American drone makers. Wow. And that's why, that's why Chinese own the drone market, and that's why 90% of the drones used by the U.S. military and by U.S. police are Chinese-made drones, which, again- That sounds like a terrible security risk. Is a very bad idea, because every Chinese drone is both a potential surveillance platform and a potential weapon. Oh, criminy. Yes. Well, I've seen the advancements in Chinese drones in particular, the choreographed dances that they do in the sky, where they had, did you see the dragon one? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. The Chinese dragon drone display, it's like one of the largest ones they ever did. It's unbelievable how much more advanced they are. Yeah. And I will tell you, the Biden administration had zero interest in addressing this, or worse than zero. Like just, I would say, absolute contempt for the idea of a U.S. drone industry. So let's watch this thing, so you can go full screen on that. Like this is just a grid in the sky, look at this. They're flying up together. They did one that was at night, Jamie, because they were all lit up. It's on this video, it's just full. Oh, okay. I can skip ahead if you want. So imagine those with guns. Jesus Christ. Coming at you, right? Well, we get to see some of that in Ukraine. Yeah. 100%. Absolutely. Yeah. We've seen those suicide drones. Like, look at this. That dragon in the sky is drones that are all lit up. I mean, that is unbelievable. Yeah. It even has a puff of fire coming out of its mouth. That's incredible. If they send that at a football stadium during a game with grenades on those drones. Oh my God. It's carnage. Dude, don't even put that out there. Don't put that voodoo on me, Ricky Bobby. Sorry. Look at that heart in the sky with a heartbeat. Correct. This is insane. Correct. Yes. It's so incredible. Yes. They had a little one like that that played over the M&M concert when I was at COTA at the Circuits of the Americas here. They had this giant M&M concert, there was like 100,000 people there, and then afterwards they had drones in the sky that did little dances. Chinese drones. I bet. I bet they were. They were. They weren't like this though. It wasn't at that level. That's unbelievable. Enjoy the show while you can. That's crazy that that's a Chinese thing only. Yeah. Look, DOD runs on these. Soldiers in the field, it's very common soldiers, just soldiers, normal ground soldiers in the field carry drones in their backpacks because they want to be able to see what's around the building or up on the roof. Yeah. And these are Chinese-made drones. Chinese drones. And every single one of them can be taken over by China and used for whatever they want. Oh my God. Anytime they want. Is the Trump administration on this? They're very ... I don't know what they'll do. It's somewhere in the priority order of the things that they're dealing with, but yes, they are well aware of this. And it's the kind of thing I would hope that would get some attention. Yeah. Yeah. Well, this brings us back to the UAP thing. Because if that's what we're seeing, we're seeing super sophisticated Chinese drones that operate on some novel propulsion system. That's not good. Yeah. And that could be because they put ridiculous regulations on drone manufacturers in America. Yeah. That's right. And they got way ahead of us. Yeah. These are bad. These are bad. These are bad paths. It's also, you're just opening my eyes to this. I always had this rose-colored glasses view of our society versus the Chinese society. Our society is more open. So people can innovate and come up with new startups and all these crazy ideas. Because there's so much freedom in America, they don't have to deal with the government being involved in every business. Silly me. Well- Silly me. I was wrong. There's an argument I make geopolitically in DC, which is, if you imagine that the 21st century is going to be, let's say, a contest between the US and China, the same way that in the 20th century it was the US versus the Soviet Union, contest, competition, Cold War, maybe hot war. Yeah. That's the basic fundamental geopolitical puzzle of the 21st century. Then you want to think very clearly about the strengths and weaknesses of both yourselves and about the other side. And then as you think about how to beat the other guy, is the answer to become more like them or more like yourself? Jane Waters made that argument when it comes to social digital scores and cryptocurrency and a centralized digital currency. She was talking about that. In order to compete with China, we have to come up with a centralized digital currency. Which in my view is exactly the wrong thing.
I was like, that's a terrible idea. It's exactly the wrong thing. You gotta be like China to compete with China? It's exactly the wrong thing. It's exactly the wrong thing. You don't want that. Because the China system has its problems. They terrorize their own population directly. They do impose the social credits course stuff. They do all this stuff. And then, by the way, here's something we have going for us, which is the Chinese system has turned on capitalism. Xi Jinping is not a capitalist, and there is a broad-based crackdown on private business in China. A friend of mine, one of the leading investors in China, he said every single Chinese tech founder has either left China or wants to leave China. And they're all trying to get their money out, and they're all trying to get their families out because it's now too dangerous to run a tech company in China because the government might just snatch you, like literally, physically snatch you at any point, and you may or may not come back. And then every Chinese CEO has a political officer of the Chinese Communist Party sitting down the hall who can come in and override your decisions anytime he wants to, and by the way, and drag you into training. This is a great thing. You're the CEO of a company with 50 billion in revenue and 100,000 employees, and this guy from the CCP comes in and pulls you, and you sit in the conference room down the hall for seven hours getting grilled on how well you understand Marx. That actually happens. It's political officers. And that's the kind of thing that happened in the Soviet Union, and that's the kind of thing that happens in China. So you'd rather be a CEO in the US than in China, for sure, as long as the US system actually stays open, where you can actually get all the benefits of all the power of all these incredibly smart people building companies and building products. And that's why this administration freaked us out so much, is because it felt like they were trying to become way more like China. See, I was not nearly as aware as I should have been about all these things that you're saying. I didn't know this. I did know about the banks, and I certainly didn't know that they were cracking down on AI the same way they crack down on social media. The AI thing was very alarming. We had meetings this spring that were the most alarming meetings I've ever been in, where they were taking us through their plans, and it was- What kind of... Can you talk about it? Full government control, this sort of thing. There will be a small number of large companies that will be completely regulated and controlled by the government. They told us, they just said, don't even start startups, don't even bother. There's just no way. There's no way that they can succeed. There's no way that we're going to permit that to happen. Wow. Yeah, they just said, this is already over. It's going to be two or three companies, and we're going to control them, and that's that. This is already finished. Oh my God. Now, when you leave a meeting like that, what do you do? You go endorse Donald Trump. Oh my God. And again, I'll just tell you, because I'm going to get a lot of... The flak I'm going to get for this is, he's just a crazy, whatever, right-winger, but I was a Democrat. I was a Democrat. I supported Bill Clinton in 92. I supported Clinton in 96. I supported Gore, who I knew very well, in 2000. I knew John Kerry. I supported him in 04. I supported Obama. I supported Hillary in 16. I was a Democrat in good standing. Are you completely out in the cocktail circuit now? Are you allowed to hang out with people? This is actually true. There's now two kinds of dinner parties in Silicon Valley. They fractured cleanly in half. There's the ones where every person there believes every single thing that was in the New York Times that day, which, by the way, is often very different than whatever was in the New York Times six months ago, but everybody has fully updated their views for that day, and that's what they talk about at the dinner party, and I am no longer invited to those, nor do I want to go to them, and then there's the other kind, which is David Sachs and all these guys and all these people and just this growing universe. It's a microcosm of what's happening more broadly in the culture, which is like, hey, let's actually get together and talk about things and have fun. Right, but it's so much more comforting when it's you guys and not the MyPillow guy. You know what I mean? No disrespect, Mike, to the MyPillow guy, but you know what I'm saying? I want people that are smarter than me to be saying these things. That's what helps. It helps when you say, well, this person actually knows what they're talking about. They're very well informed, and they understand the repercussions. They understand what's been coming their way, and there's people like yourself that can speak about ... The plans that you're laying out, what they were trying to do with AI, is fucking terrifying. That should terrify everybody, where you have bureaucrats who are now in control of potentially the biggest agent of change in the history of the human race, potentially, and you're going to let what? The people that can't even balance the budget? People that don't know what the fuck is going on? That sounds insane. Yep. Yep. And look, my hope, I think, under Clinton and Gore, I think that they dealt with this very different. I mean, look, they dealt with the internet very differently than the current cropper are dealing with these technologies. Well, it was very different. It was very different, but also, they were much more ... Clinton and Gore, in particular, were much more understanding that you could ... So, there used to be this thing I called The Deal, with a capital D, and The Deal was, you could be, and this is what I was, you could be a tech founder, you could start a private company, you could create a tech product. Everybody loved you. It was great. Glowing press coverage, the whole thing. You take the company public. It employs a lot of people. It creates a lot of jobs. You make a lot of money. At some point, you cash out, and then you donate all the money to charity, and everybody thinks you're a hero.
Right, it's just great. Right. And this is how it ran for a very long time. And this was the deal. This was, you know, the deal, this was Clinton and Gore with 100% support of that. And they were 100% pro capitalism in this way and 100% pro tech. And they actually did a lot to foster this kind of environment. And basically, what happened is the last 15 years or so Democrats culminating in this administration, basically broke every part of that deal. For people in my world, like every single part of that was shattered, right, where just like technology became presumptively evil. Right. And like, you know, if you're a business person, you were presumptively a bad person, and then technology was presumptively had bad effects and dot dot dot, and then they were going to regulate you and try to kill you and quash you. And then the kicker was philanthropy became evil. And this is a real culture change in the last five years that I hope will reverse now, which is philanthropy now is a dirty word on the left, because it's the private person choosing to give away the money as opposed to the government choosing a way to give the money. So I'll give you the ultimate case that here's where I radicalized on this topic. So you'll recall some years back, Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, you know, they have a ton of money in Facebook stock, they created a nonprofit entity called Chan Zuckerberg initiative, which which the original mission was to literally cure all disease. And this could be like, you know, $200 billion going to cure all disease, right? So like a big deal. They said they committed to donate 99% of their assets to this to this new foundation. They got brutally attacked from the left and the attack was they're only doing it to save money on taxes. Now, basic mathematics, you don't give away 99% of your money to save money on taxes, right? But it was a vicious attack. It was like a very, very aggressive attack. And the fundamental reason for the attack was how dare they treat that money like it's their own? How dare they decide where it goes? Instead, tax rates for billionaires should go to 90 something percent, the government should take the money and the government should allocate it. And that would be the morally proper and correct thing to do. What do you think is the root of that kind of thinking? utopian? This is a utopian collectivism. You know, it's the it's socialism. That was socialism. Yeah, it's the core idea of socialism. Like the core idea is this, this is sort of, there's a radical egalitarianism, everybody should be exactly the same, all outcomes should be exactly the same. Everything should be completely fair. And some route of it has to be an envy. Of course, yeah. resentment. Yes. Nietzsche had this great term called resentment. And it's like turbocharged resentment. And so the way he described his resentment is envy, resentment and bitterness. That is so intense that it causes an inversion of values. And the things that used to be good become bad. And the things that used to be bad become good. Right. And that's how philanthropy becomes bad for philanthropy becomes bad, because it should be the state operating on behalf of the people as a whole who are handing out the money, not the individual. I was not aware of that blowback. I would have loved to read some of those comments. I would like to go to their page and see what else they comment. I'll give you another example. Here's another radicalizing moment. So my friend Sheryl Sandberg, who I worked with very closely for a long time at Facebook, you know, and by the way, Democrat, you know, liberal, and by the way, endorsed Kamala, like very much not on the same page as me on these things. She actually worked in the Clinton administration, you know, died in the world Democrats. She wrote this book called lean in about 12 years ago. It's this sort of feminist manifesto. And it basically lean in, lean in, lean in. And the thesis of lean in was that women in their lives and careers could quote, unquote, lean in. She said what she observed in a lot of meetings was the men were leaning into the table and sitting like in front and then the women were like leaning back and waiting to be called on. She said that women should lean in, it became a metaphor for her for women should like lean in on their careers. They should like aggressively advocate for themselves to get like raises and promotions like men do like men do. They should basically women should basically become more aggressive in the workplace and then therefore, you know, perform better. And so it was like, it was a manifesto to women basically saying be more confident, be more assertive, be more aggressive, be more successful. And I read the draft of the book when she was writing it. And I said, well, you know, you realize you've written a right wing manifesto. Right. And she looks at me like I've lost my mind, right? Because she's a lifelong lifelong lefty. She's like, what do you mean? And I'm like, you this book is a statement that women have agency. Right? This book is a statement that the things that women choose to do will lead to better results. But that's what people believe on the right on the left of people believe is that women are only always and ever victims. Wow. And if a woman doesn't succeed in a career, it's because she's being discriminated against. And so I said, I said, I predicted when this book comes out, right wingers are going to think it's great. And you're going to get it. Like the left is going to come at you because you're violating the fundamental principle of the left, which is anybody who does less well as a victim, which in that case is exactly what happened. By the way, the reviews were all by women and they tore into her, like in every major publication, they just like completely ripped her. How dare this rich entitled woman be telling us, you know, these would be telling women that they're not victims and that they're, you know, that they have all this agency because this is denial of sexism, right? It's denial of oppression. Wow. Cause imagine if a man wrote a book like that for men, right? That was patriarchy, right? That's yeah. That'd be wow. But I mean, but men wouldn't attack it. Oh, right. Exactly. Right. It would be a guidebook. Yeah. This is how you kick ass and get ahead. Yeah. We call it self-help lean in bro.
Lean in Lean in bro, exactly, right? Wow, that's crazy. It's a good attack for that. So again, it's this inversion. It's resentment It's the inversion which is like advocating on your own behalf and choosing to do things that make you what was her reaction to that Well, I would say she was I don't want to speak for her, but she was not Not pleased. I mean also was she shocked that you're correct. Did you have a follow-up conversation with her? What did she talk about a lot like goddammit mark? How'd you see that one coming? So she was in the but the answer is she was her her world view of how these things worked was from a different It was from the Clinton Gore era right in which you could win which you could say they talk like that You could talk like yes, and by the time the book came out It was already into the second Obama term heading it right and it was and then the what will the book stuff started and then? At that point you could no longer say things like that Wow And everything got classified through this very hard-edged right us versus them right oppressor versus oppressed boy and so it's such a It's such a contrast to what we hoped would happen when Obama would be president. That's right. My thought was okay Look, there's still some racism But clearly if you're the baddest motherfucker, you can get ahead like you can win the country will vote for you That's not what happened. No, and you can win again. You would twice you win twice and be like I've always said up until I've lost a lot of respect for him from some of the things that he said during this Election cycle because I think they got desperate and they just resorted to actual lies And I thought this is crazy to see him lying especially the very fine people hoax and we played the video back and forth of what Obama said he said and what he actually said and it's pretty shocking because he's very explicit You know, he's saying not white nationalists not neo-nazis. They should be condemned. He says that very clearly that's not I'm talking about talking about people who are protesting the taking down of the statue right and When you see a guy like Obama do that It's such a bummer because he was the guy for me. That was like our best spokesman He was like here's a guy that came from a single family a single parent household It wasn't some rich entitled kid who was given everything in life. He's this brilliant speaker He he's like he's handsome. He represents like what we're hoping for We're hoping for a colorblind society just treats people on the merit of who they are and anyone can achieve and look here He made it and then all sudden identity politics goes through the fucking roof and Victim mentality becomes a thing that people choose to side with and it it just gets real weird for a long time Yeah, that's right That's right. And like I said, I hope they can find their way back. So but this lady still on team Kamala. Oh, yeah She got a few lessons out of that but not all of them Well, no, this is if you're you know, if you've been a lifelong Democrat If you've been a lifelong Democrat and if that's you know, if that is in this quarter a lot of people's value systems Then it's it's a real challenge, you know, oh, yeah, it's my parents when your movement Goes in directions. Well, yeah, and there's you know, right and you can shoot you can choose to follow You can choose to follow into the you know The craziest version of it or you can choose to say, you know what like I'm still not gonna switch sides But at least I'm gonna advocate right for my team to come back. Yeah, this is Richie Torres No, this guy is a congressman in in in Queens. I think or the Bronx He's actually it actually started out everybody thought he was gonna be a far leftie because he's gay he's black he's Latino He was like us He was like at least associated with the squad early on and he's like one of the guys in the Democratic Party who has now Stood up and he's been doing this in public for the last two weeks saying Clearly we have to get back to sense like we have to get back to common sense. We have to get back to moderation Yeah, we have to we have to have law enforcement. We have to have you know, we can't have crime in the streets We have to have a border You know We have to we have to get we the Democrats have to get back to moderation and sense and so he is hoping to lead The party that's great that I think he's we support him and I think he's like a really I think he's a very impressive guy So there are people like and he's young and very energetic and you know, I think he has a very bright future But that's the kind of person who could lead the party Well, the big Nietzschean shift was when Dick Cheney endorsed Kamala and everybody cheered If there's not a better example than that, please tell me what it is because that one was fucking nuts Like Dick Cheney was always the hard right like during the Bush administration All the lefties looked at him like that was Satan. That's right. He was the profiteer. That's right He was the the manipulator. He was the guy pulling the strings Yeah, he was the CEO of Hal Burton that came the whole thing was so crazy and to see Oh Dick Cheney Just endorsed Kamala and everybody's like yay. Look Dick Cheney's on our side like what the fuck are you guys talking about? This is this is the best shift of it, right? Yeah, that's right. That's right That's right All of us are at all of a sudden we're on the all of a sudden we were all neocons all of a sudden as you said All of a sudden we're pro-war It's like wait, wait, you know cuz like as you know, like the number, you know, yeah, the Democrats used to be the anti-war party Yes, they were the anti-war party for a very long time. Yes. Yes Yeah Except back when they were trying to keep slavery in act Part of the problem that was a different don't realize that
that was a different era. But yeah, you know, what coming out of Vietnam, they were definitely the antiwar party for like, you know, 30. Isn't that a shift as well? Yeah. But the shift of the Republicans from back in the day, being Abraham Lincoln, and that trying to get rid of slavery, and the Democrats fighting to keep it like this, these weird ideological swings, they happen. And, you know, we're still attached to the idea of being a democrat is like being a Clinton Democrat. We're in this weird sort of denial of what the ideology actually stands for versus how we think of ourselves. When we say I'm a democrat, I'm a good person. You know, I support civil rights, women's rights, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, down the line, I'm a democrat. And if you go against that, well, now you're against all these things that you know, to be inherently important for society. Yeah, that's right. They gotcha. Yeah, that's right. They got you. They roped you into some crazy thing. We're supporting war. And then there is the big faction, right? There's the big free Palestine versus support Israel. Yeah, because the left always supported Israel. 100%. And then all of a sudden, there's this free Palestine movement, which divides the left even further. Yeah. There's this book, there's a book written some years back by this guy, Norman Podhoretz, and that's good. So why are Jews liberal? Right? And he was a right wing, he was right wing Jew, a very important Jewish thinker, American Jewish thinker of like, in the 60s, 70s, 80s. And he's like, he basically was like, basically, he had this thesis that like these Jewish liberal voters in the US, like basically are voting against ultimately, they're voting for the wrong team. Because what they don't understand, basically, is that this is sort of a path number one to anti semitism, which is what's happened. But number two, the basically, you're never going to have long term support for Israel from the left, because Israel, the basic concept of Israel violates that, you know, the idea that Israel is like literally a religious ethnostate. Right. And that's like inherently a right wing idea, not a left wing, right? Like the left doesn't have room for the military superpower in the military, right, and is able to write is able to and it's run by a former special forces operator. Very, yes, very, very capable. Yes, very capable soldier. And he's a fucking assassin. Exactly. And so, you know, he argued, I don't know, it's like, whatever, 20 years ago, he's like, this is headed in the wrong direction. And but you know, the argument was ignored at the time. And then, you know, at least a lot of my Jewish friends after October 7, you know, they were completely horrified, you know, to find out, for example, the DEI was actually anti Jewish, right, which is what everybody learned with the scandals at the universities, right? And it's like, you know, there's two ways of looking at that one is, oh, my God, the DEI is anti Jewish. Therefore, we need to add Jews to the DEI scorecard, right? Well, when we saw the heads of Harvard, and was it MIT? Was it Yale? No, it was Harvard, MIT in Columbia. Yeah, that was, yeah, that's right. That was just so in everyone's face. And so bananas. Well, and then we saw that, right. And then we saw is that this the same sort of radicalized left had actually slid into not just anti Semitism, and not just anti Israel, but also pro, I mean, ultimately, pro terrorist pro Hamas. Yeah, you know, the new acronym, or LGBT H. No, right. But there's a bunch of other stuff in there. Now. There's a queue, there's two spirit. No, but you gotta get H in there now for Hamas. Oh, boy. Really? Of course, of course, of course. And so so like, yeah, I bring it, I bring it up, just as an not to take a position, just as an example of it's the kind of realignment. Yeah, a lot of Jewish Americans now are having to kind of rethink fundamental questions about political structure and alliances and who they should be part of and who they shouldn't be part of. So I think to your point, I think like the whole country is going through, I think we're going through the first, like, profound political realignment, probably since the 1960s. Yeah, which is which is when everything shifted between Johnson and Nixon. In the south. I think we're going through like the most profound version of that right now. And I think it's it's something like the multi ethnic working class coalition, you know, that came together around Trump, you know, basically, again, against this sort of super exaggerated elite plus underclass, you know, kind of structure that the Democrats have built for themselves. And it just it just turns out there's just a lot more people in the middle. And so I think but but by the way, including a lot of a lot of black people, a lot of black people, you know, black vote for Trump is way up Hispanic vote for Trump is way up right vote for Trump is way up way up gay vote is like all of yes, all of the identity groups that Democrats relied on all these years are union vote is for Trump. I'm sure you've seen the map, the electoral map of California. 2024 and 2020. Yes. In contrast, it's a crazy red wave that's going through across the whole the most of the state is red now. Those of us on the coast are going to get pushed into the ocean. Yes. Well, I think, you know, maybe the other way we were talking about the hopeful way that the Democrats will wake up. Yeah. And come up with a more reasonable I mean, there's obviously clear cultural pushback on all these crazier crazier issues. And I mean, like, the giant pushback from women about biological men competing against women. I mean, this is a giant one where women are like, listen, we create a title nine for a reason. Like we want women's sports to be for women, you can't have them for mentally ill men that think that they can be able to just decide they're a woman and compete against women, which is what it is in a lot of places, you don't even have to get tested. There's not like some sort of
hormone protocol. It's just like, it's just what your identity is, which is just nuts. And that's one of the things that I think a lot of people on the left are having a really hard time justifying. Yeah, right. Because how can you how can you deny a victim group? Right, right. You can't I mean, in the in the full version of that idea, and the extreme version ideology, you cannot deny any, you cannot deny a victim claim. What also comes with this weird caveat where you have to deny the existence of perverts, because a pervert, all they have to do is say, I identify as a woman throw on a wig, and now you can go hang around the women's room, and no one could say anything. Well, you've you've emboldened empowered one of the worst groups in society that we've always protected women from. And you have to pretend they don't exist. If you just want to base it solely on identity, especially like a self described identity, you just decide, and then that's it. And, you know, I mean, there's states that have that now with prisoners, that all prisoner has to do is identify with being a woman, and you are now housed in women's prisons. California is 47 of them, when the last time I looked at it, and there's hundreds that are waiting on like a waiting list to try to get in. So you have women who, you know, especially if you're someone who's dealing with, if you've ever been raped or sexually abused. And now you have to share space with a man who might be a fucking pervert. And some of these men even have some crimes that are along those lines that they're in jail for. It's crazy. I mean, Canada is the worst at it. There's a bunch of different examples of these type of people getting in female prisons, and it's just it's insanity. And I think the left rejects that too, for the most part, there's the sensible version of the left that is like, hey, yeah, I'm pro gay rights. Yeah, I'm pro women's rights. I'm pro civil rights. I'm pro choice. I'm pro this. I'm anti warm up. But also, you can't let psychos just put on a fucking dress and hang out in women's rooms just because we want to be kind. Like, that's nuts. So there has to be some and then there's legitimate trans women. So like, how do you make the distinct? Well, clearly, we have to have a fucking conversation. And if you don't allow that conversation to take place, like, if you go to blue sky, and you type in there are only two genders, you're banned. You're right there. People have done it. There's a bunch of people have done it. It's fun. Yeah, it's fun. They have like, they've created a little sock puppet account. They say some shit that should have been a reasonable thing to say just 20 years ago. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you make me hopeful, Mark. Good. You do? You do? Because you lay things out in like a really well thought out way that is not hyperbolic, and you're making a lot of sense. So I'm glad we talked. I feel better. Good. Fantastic. I think the world does, too. I really do. I mean, I've talked to a lot of people, even people that are Democrats, they said, I feel better that Trump won. Every day, it feels better. It's just like, you know, it feels like just things are opening up. It's the Obama campaign. It's hope and change. Yeah, hope and change. It's hope you change. This is kind of actually hope and change. Yeah, this is actually it. It feels like oxygen return. Yes. Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Mark. I really appreciate you. Tell everybody, your Substack, how to find you on social media. Oh, I'm on X under Pmarkay. I'm on Substack. Google me. All right. Ask Perplexity. All right. Ask ChatGPT, and it will deny that. No, it will happily tell you that I exist, at least last time I checked. What about Wikipedia? Yeah, we don't know. We don't know if Catherine is still running it. Always a pleasure, Mark. Thank you very much. Appreciate you. All right. Bye, everybody. Bye.
